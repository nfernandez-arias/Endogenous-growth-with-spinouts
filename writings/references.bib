	abstract = {The impact of R\&D on growth through spillovers has been a major topic of economic research over the last thirty years. A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing “spillovers” : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and productmarket space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R\&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R\&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R\&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R\&D because they operate more in technological niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the aggregate e↵ect of non-competition employment contracts,
agreements that exclude employees from joining competing firms for a duration of time,
in the managerial labor market. These contracts encourage firm investment but restrict
manager mobility. To explore this tradeo↵, I develop a dynamic contracting model in
which firms use non-competition to enforce buyout payment when their managers are
poached, ultimately extracting rent from outside firms. Such rent extraction encour-
ages initial employing firms to undertake more investment, as they partially capture
the external payo↵, but distorts manager allocation. I show that the privately-optimal
contract over-extracts rent by setting an excessively long non-competition duration.
Therefore, restrictions on non-competition can improve efficiency. To quantitatively
evaluate the theory, I assemble a new dataset on non-competition contracts for ex-
ecutives in U.S. public firms. Using the contract data, I find that executives under
non-competition are associated with a lower separation rate and higher firm invest-
ment. I also provide new empirical evidence consistent with non-competition reducing
wage-backloading in the model. The calibrated model suggests that the optimal re-
striction on non-competition duration is close to banning non-competition.},

	abstract = {[A model of endogenous growth is developed in which vertical innovations, generated by a competitive research sector, constitute the underlying source of growth. Equilibrium is determined by a forward-looking difference equation, according to which the amount of research in any period depends upon the expected amount of research next period. One source of this intertemporal relationship is creative destruction. That is, the prospect of more future research discourages current research by threatening to destroy the rents created by current research. The paper analyzes the positive and normative properties of stationary equilibria, in which research employment is constant and GNP follows a random walk with drift, although under some circumstances cyclical equilibria also exist. Both the average growth rate and the variance of the growth rate are increasing functions of the size of innovations, the size of the skilled labor force, and the productivity of research as measured by a parameter indicating the effect of research on the Poisson arrival rate of innovations; and decreasing functions of the rate of time preference of the representative individual. Under laissez faire the economy's growth rate may be more or less than optimal because, in addition to the appropriability and intertemporal spillover effects of other endogenous growth models, which tend to make growth slower than optimal, the model also has effects that work in the opposite direction. In particular, the fact that private research firms do not internalize the destruction of rents generated by their innovations introduces a business-stealing effect similar to that found in the partial-equilibrium patent race literature. When we endogenize the size of innovations we find that business stealing also makes innovations too small.]},

Although information technology has diminished in significance since the dot-com crash of 2000 and observed growth rates have slowed recently, we project that private sector productivity growth will average around 2.4 percent per year for the next decade, only moderately below the average of the post-1995 period.},

Depending on definition, employee spinoffs account for between one-sixth and one-third of the new firms in Brazil's private sector during this period. Regardless of definition, size at entry is larger for employee spinoffs than for new firms without parents but smaller than for diversification ventures of existing firms. Similarly, survival rates for employee spinoffs are higher than for new firms without parents and comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firms.

However, these shocks increase the investment rate at existing knowledge-intensive firms.

ship, innovation and productivity growth. I study the effect of NCL on the creation of employee
spinouts (firms created by former employees of incumbent firms) and the implications of this
process for aggregate productivity growth. The process of spinout formation introduces a
nontrivial tradeoff between growth-enhancing knowledge diffusion in the form of new produc-
tive firms, on the one hand, and the threat of knowledge dissemination and competition that
harms innovation by incumbents, on the other hand. I use patents and inventors’ data to iden-
tify spinout entrants and empirically explore their characteristics. I document that 1) they
outperform regular entrants with no prior experience, 2) spinouts are more likely to separate
from more innovative firms, 3) more productive firms spawn better spinouts, and 4) states with
weaker NCL have higher rates of spinout entry. To analyze the interaction between incumbents
innovation incentives and spinout entry, I develop a dynamic general equilibrium endogenous
growth model consistent with empirical facts from the data. After calibrating the parameters
of the model, I quantify the importance for growth of the two above-mentioned channels. I then
quantitatively investigate the implications of different non-compete policies. I find that it is
welfare improving to abolish existing non-compete restrictions; however, the policy protecting

This paper explores a legal constraint on mobility—employee non-compete agreements—by exploiting Michigan's apparently inadvertent 1985 reversal of its non-compete enforcement policy as a natural experiment. Using a differences-in-differences approach, and controlling for changes in the auto industry central to Michigan's economy, we find that the enforcement of non-competes indeed attenuates mobility. Moreover, non-compete enforcement decreases mobility more sharply for inventors with firm-specific skills and for those who specialize in narrow technical fields. The results speak to the literature on employee mobility while offering a credibly exogenous source of variation that can extend previous research on the implications of such mobility.},

Exploiting an inadvertent policy reversal in Michigan as a natural experiment, we show that non-compete agreements are responsible for a “brain drain” of knowledge workers out of states that enforce such contracts to states where they are not enforceable. Importantly, this effect is felt most strongly on the margin of workers who are more collaborative and whose work is more impactful.},

First, a number of new theoretical results: (i) an analytic characterization of the consumption and saving behavior of the poor, particularly their marginal propensities to consume; (ii) a closed-form solution for the wealth distribution in a special case with two income types; (iii) a proof that there is a unique stationary equilibrium if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is weakly greater than one; (iv) a characterization of “soft” borrowing constraints. Second, we develop a simple, eﬃcient and portable algorithm for numerically solving for equilibria in a wide class of heterogeneous agent models, including – but not limited to – the Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett model.},

Controlling for firm size, patents, and industry, the most prolific spawners are originally venture-backed companies located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts. Undiversified firms spawn more firms. Silicon Valley, Massachusetts, and originally venture-backed firms typically spawn firms only peripherally related to their core businesses. Overall, entrepreneurial learning and networks appear important in creating venture-backed firms.},

This is among the highest compared to other countries. Productivity growth at the industry level is even higher, reflecting the dynamic force of creative destruction. Over the entire period, net entry accounts for over two thirds of total TFP growth. In contrast to earlier studies looking at total non-agriculture including services, we find that TFP growth dominates input accumulation as a source of output growth.},

To analyze this relationship, we develop a simple model of firm entry and exit based on Hopenhayn (1992) in which there are analytical expressions for the FHK decomposition. When we introduce reforms that reduce entry costs or reduce barriers to technology adoption into a calibrated model, we find that the entry and exit terms in the FHK decomposition become more important as GDP grows rapidly, just as they do in the data from Chile and Korea.},

Noncompetes are more likely to be found in high-skill, high-paying jobs, but they are also common in low-skill, low-paying jobs as well as in states that do not enforce them. Less than 10\% of employees negotiate over their noncompetes and roughly one-third of noncompetes are signed after applicants have already accepted their job offers (but not with a raise or promotion). Differences in the timing of the noncompete are associated with different outcomes: those presented with a noncompete before accepting the associated job offer earn 9.7\% higher wages, receive 11\% more training, and are 6.6\% more satisfied in their job than those not bound by noncompetes. However, those asked to sign after accepting the job offer are 12.5\% less satisfied in their job and experience no wage and training benefits.

	abstract = {The effect of competition on innovation incentives has been a controversial subject in economics since Joseph Schumpeter advanced the theory that competitive markets are not necessarily the most effective organizations to promote innovation. The incentive to innovate is the difference in profit that a firm can earn if it invests in research and development compared to what it would earn if it did not invest. The concept is straightforward, yet differences in market structure, the characteristics of innovations, and the dynamics of discovery lead to seemingly endless variations in the theoretical relationship between competition and expenditures on research and development or the outputs of research and development (R\&amp;D). This paper surveys the economic theory of innovation, focusing on market structure and its relationship to competition, the distinction between product and process innovations, and the role of exclusive and nonexclusive rights to innovation, and draws conclusions from the different models. Exclusive rights generally lead to greater innovation incentives in more competitive markets, while nonexclusive rights generally lead to the opposite conclusion, although there are important exceptions. The paper reviews the large literature on empirical studies of innovation and finds some support for the predictions of the theory.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of non-competition agreements on the type of R\&D activity undertaken by companies. Non-competition agreements, by reducing outbound mobility and knowledge leakages to competitors, make high-risk R\&D projects relatively more valuable than low-risk ones. Thus, they induce companies to choose riskier R\&D projects, such that corporate inventions are more likely to lie in the tails of the inventions' value distribution (as breakthroughs or failures) and be in novel technological areas. This study uses data about U.S. patent applications from 1990 to 2000 and considers longitudinal variation in the enforcement of non-compete clauses. The results indicate that in states with stricter enforcement, companies undertake riskier R\&D paths than in states that do not enforce non-compete agreements as strictly.

This is equivalent to a deterministic optimal control problem in which the state variable is the infinite-dimensional cross-sectional distribution. We show how, in continuous time, the problem can be broken down into two finite-dimensional partial differential equations: a dynamic programming equation and the law of motion of the distribution, and we introduce a new numerical algorithm to solve it. We illustrate this methodology with two examples: social optima in an Aiyagari economy with stochastic lifetimes and in a model of on-the-job search with learning.},

We explore whether relatively small spatial units (metropolitan statistical areas) in close geographic proximity to firms that recently have been acquired or experienced an IPO exhibit high new venture creation rates and whether the magnitudes of these effects depend on regional differences in statutes governing the freedom of employees to move between employers. Count models of biotechnology firm foundings establish three findings: (1) IPOs of organizations located contiguous to or within an MSA accelerate the founding rate within that MSA, (2) acquisitions of biotech firms situated near to or within an MSA accelerate the founding rate within the MSA, but only when the acquirer enters from outside of the biotech industry, and (3) the enforceability of post-employment non-compete covenants, which is determined at the state level, strongly moderates these effects.]},

We use employer-employee matched data in ordinary least squares and instrumental variables analyses to assess four hypotheses.

Instead, it increases employee departures to entrepreneurship, leading employees to join the founding teams of startups that are venture capital-backed, high tech, high wage, and in different sectors than the parent firm. These high-growth, high-risk startups emerging from R\&D benefit from a focused, standalone incentive structure and have poor complementarities to the parent firm’s assets.},

An increase from non-enforcement to mean enforceability is associated with a 14\% increase in training, which tends to be firm-sponsored and designed to upgrade or teach new skills. In contrast to theoretical expectations, the results show no evidence of a relationship between noncompete enforceability and self-sponsored training. Despite the increases in training, an increase from non-enforcement to mean enforceability is associated with a 4\% decrease in hourly wages. Consistent with reduced bargaining power, noncompete enforceability is associated with a reduction in the return to tenure, and less educated workers experience additional wage losses in the face of increased enforceability relative to more educated workers. Suggestive evidence indicates that consideration policies exhibit differential effects relative to other types of noncompete policies.},

The approach is based on the very powerful and simple framework developed by Barles– Souganidis [4], see the review of the previous chapter. The key property here is the monotonicity which guarantees that the scheme satisfies the same ellipticity condition as the HJB operator. I will provide a number of examples of monotone schemes in these notes. In practice, pure finite difference schemes are only useful in 1, 2, or at most 3 spatial dimensions. One of their merits is to be quite simple and easy to implement. Also, as shown in the previous chapter, they can also be combined with Monte Carlo methods to solve nonlinear parabolic PDEs.},
