	abstract = {The impact of R\&D on growth through spillovers has been a major topic of economic research over the last thirty years. A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing “spillovers” : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and productmarket space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R\&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R\&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R\&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R\&D because they operate more in technological niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the aggregate e↵ect of non-competition employment contracts, agreements that exclude employees from joining competing firms for a duration of time, in the managerial labor market. These contracts encourage firm investment but restrict manager mobility. To explore this tradeo↵, I develop a dynamic contracting model in which firms use non-competition to enforce buyout payment when their managers are poached, ultimately extracting rent from outside firms. Such rent extraction encour- ages initial employing firms to undertake more investment, as they partially capture the external payo↵, but distorts manager allocation. I show that the privately-optimal contract over-extracts rent by setting an excessively long non-competition duration. Therefore, restrictions on non-competition can improve efficiency. To quantitatively evaluate the theory, I assemble a new dataset on non-competition contracts for ex- ecutives in U.S. public firms. Using the contract data, I find that executives under non-competition are associated with a lower separation rate and higher firm invest- ment. I also provide new empirical evidence consistent with non-competition reducing wage-backloading in the model. The calibrated model suggests that the optimal re- striction on non-competition duration is close to banning non-competition.},

	abstract = {[A model of endogenous growth is developed in which vertical innovations, generated by a competitive research sector, constitute the underlying source of growth. Equilibrium is determined by a forward-looking difference equation, according to which the amount of research in any period depends upon the expected amount of research next period. One source of this intertemporal relationship is creative destruction. That is, the prospect of more future research discourages current research by threatening to destroy the rents created by current research. The paper analyzes the positive and normative properties of stationary equilibria, in which research employment is constant and {GNP} follows a random walk with drift, although under some circumstances cyclical equilibria also exist. Both the average growth rate and the variance of the growth rate are increasing functions of the size of innovations, the size of the skilled labor force, and the productivity of research as measured by a parameter indicating the effect of research on the Poisson arrival rate of innovations; and decreasing functions of the rate of time preference of the representative individual. Under laissez faire the economy's growth rate may be more or less than optimal because, in addition to the appropriability and intertemporal spillover effects of other endogenous growth models, which tend to make growth slower than optimal, the model also has effects that work in the opposite direction. In particular, the fact that private research firms do not internalize the destruction of rents generated by their innovations introduces a business-stealing effect similar to that found in the partial-equilibrium patent race literature. When we endogenize the size of innovations we find that business stealing also makes innovations too small.]},

Although information technology has diminished in significance since the dot-com crash of 2000 and observed growth rates have slowed recently, we project that private sector productivity growth will average around 2.4 percent per year for the next decade, only moderately below the average of the post-1995 period.},

I study the effect of {NCL} on the creation of employee spinouts (firms created by former employees of incumbent firms) and the implications of this process for aggregate productivity growth. The process of spinout formation introduces a nontrivial tradeoff between growth-enhancing knowledge diffusion in the form of new produc- tive firms, on the one hand, and the threat of knowledge dissemination and competition that harms innovation by incumbents, on the other hand. I use patents and inventors’ data to iden- tify spinout entrants and empirically explore their characteristics. I document that 1) they outperform regular entrants with no prior experience, 2) spinouts are more likely to separate from more innovative firms, 3) more productive firms spawn better spinouts, and 4) states with weaker {NCL} have higher rates of spinout entry. To analyze the interaction between incumbents innovation incentives and spinout entry, I develop a dynamic general equilibrium endogenous growth model consistent with empirical facts from the data. After calibrating the parameters of the model, I quantify the importance for growth of the two above-mentioned channels. I then quantitatively investigate the implications of different non-compete policies. I find that it is welfare improving to abolish existing non-compete restrictions; however, the policy protecting firms with high technological leadership is growth-maximizing.},

Using a differences-in-differences approach, and controlling for changes in the auto industry central to Michigan's economy, we find that the enforcement of non-competes indeed attenuates mobility. Moreover, non-compete enforcement decreases mobility more sharply for inventors with firm-specific skills and for those who specialize in narrow technical fields. The results speak to the literature on employee mobility while offering a credibly exogenous source of variation that can extend previous research on the implications of such mobility.},

Our model provides a tractable framework for the analysis of growth driven by both entry of new firms and productivity improvements by continuing firms. The model generates a non-degenerate equilibrium firm size distribution driven by entry of new firms and expansion exit of existing firms. When there is also costly imitation preventing any sector from falling too far below the average, the stationary firm size distribution is Pareto with an exponent approximately equal to one (the so-called “Zipf distribution”).},

In such settings, the employee will sometimes form a new company even though joint profits would have been greater had the invention been developed with the original firm.

Nearly 1 in 5 labor force participants were bound by noncompetes in 2014, and nearly 40\% had signed at least one noncompete in the past. Noncompetes are more likely to be found in high-skill, high-paying jobs, but they are also common in low-skill, low-paying jobs as well as in states that do not enforce them. Less than 10\% of employees negotiate over their noncompetes and roughly one-third of noncompetes are signed after applicants have already accepted their job offers (but not with a raise or promotion). Differences in the timing of the noncompete are associated with different outcomes: those presented with a noncompete before accepting the associated job offer earn 9.7\% higher wages, receive 11\% more training, and are 6.6\% more satisfied in their job than those not bound by noncompetes. However, those asked to sign after accepting the job offer are 12.5\% less satisfied in their job and experience no wage and training benefits. We conclude that noncompetes may be efficient contracting tools, but that they can also serve as intertemporal conduits of monopsony power.},

	abstract = {The effect of competition on innovation incentives has been a controversial subject in economics since Joseph Schumpeter advanced the theory that competitive markets are not necessarily the most effective organizations to promote innovation. The incentive to innovate is the difference in profit that a firm can earn if it invests in research and development compared to what it would earn if it did not invest. The concept is straightforward, yet differences in market structure, the characteristics of innovations, and the dynamics of discovery lead to seemingly endless variations in the theoretical relationship between competition and expenditures on research and development or the outputs of research and development (R\&D). This paper surveys the economic theory of innovation, focusing on market structure and its relationship to competition, the distinction between product and process innovations, and the role of exclusive and nonexclusive rights to innovation, and draws conclusions from the different models. Exclusive rights generally lead to greater innovation incentives in more competitive markets, while nonexclusive rights generally lead to the opposite conclusion, although there are important exceptions. The paper reviews the large literature on empirical studies of innovation and finds some support for the predictions of the theory.},

Thus, they induce companies to choose riskier R\&D projects, such that corporate inventions are more likely to lie in the tails of the inventions' value distribution (as breakthroughs or failures) and be in novel technological areas. This study uses data about U.S. patent applications from 1990 to 2000 and considers longitudinal variation in the enforcement of non-compete clauses. The results indicate that in states with stricter enforcement, companies undertake riskier R\&D paths than in states that do not enforce non-compete agreements as strictly.

Most patents purchased would be placed in the public domain, but to induce bidders to reveal their valuations, a few would be sold to the highest bidder.]},

We study the optimal reward policy when the quality of the ideas and their subsequent development effort are private information. Monopoly power is a scarce resource to be allocated across innovators who arrive at various times. The optimal assignment of property rights must counterbalance the incentives of current and future innovators. The resulting mechanism resembles a menu of patents that have infinite duration and fixed scope. This optimal patent menu can be implemented with a simple buyout scheme: The innovator commits at the outset to a price ceiling at which he will sell his rights to a future inventor. When a larger fee is paid initially, a higher price ceiling is obtained. Any subsequent innovator must pay this price and purchase his own buyout fee contract. We relate this mechanism to the proposed compulsory licensing schemes.},

In contrast to theoretical expectations, the results show no evidence of a relationship between noncompete enforceability and self-sponsored training. Despite the increases in training, an increase from non-enforcement to mean enforceability is associated with a 4\% decrease in hourly wages. Consistent with reduced bargaining power, noncompete enforceability is associated with a reduction in the return to tenure, and less educated workers experience additional wage losses in the face of increased enforceability relative to more educated workers. Suggestive evidence indicates that consideration policies exhibit differential effects relative to other types of noncompete policies.},

The key property here is the monotonicity which guarantees that the scheme satisfies the same ellipticity condition as the {HJB} operator. I will provide a number of examples of monotone schemes in these notes. In practice, pure finite difference schemes are only useful in 1, 2, or at most 3 spatial dimensions. One of their merits is to be quite simple and easy to implement. Also, as shown in the previous chapter, they can also be combined with Monte Carlo methods to solve nonlinear parabolic {PDEs}.},

We infer this from the modest employment share of entering ﬁrms (deﬁned as those less than 5 years old). Second, most growth seems to occur through improvements of existing varieties rather than creation of brand new varieties. Third, own-product improvements by incumbents appear to be more important than creative destruction.

The basis for the analysis are the free entry condition and the fact that most R\&D innovations are embodied. Free entry yields a relationship between the resources devoted to R\&D and the growth rate of technology. Since innovators are small, this relationship is not directly affected by the size of R\&D externalities, or the presence of aggregate diminishing returns in R\&D after controlling for the growth rate of output and the interest rate. The embodiment of R\&D-driven innovations bounds the size of the production externalities. The resulting contribution of R\&D to productivity growth in the {US} is smaller than 3-5 tenths of 1\% point. This constitutes an upper bound for the case where innovators internalize the consequences of their R\&D investments on the cost of conducting future innovations. From a normative perspective, this analysis implies that, if the innovation technology takes the form assumed in the literature, the actual {US} R\&D intensity may be the socially optimal.},

Meanwhile, labor’s share of national income is down, mostly due to the rising market share of low labor share firms. We propose a theory for these trends in which the driving force is falling firm-level costs of spanning multiple markets, perhaps due to accelerating {IT} advances. In response, the most efficient firms (with higher markups) spread into new markets, thereby generating a temporary burst of growth. Because their efficiency is difficult to imitate, less efficient firms find markets more difficult to enter profitably and therefore innovate less. Eventually, due to greater competition from efficient firms, within-firm markups actually fall. Despite the increase in the aggregate markup and rents, firm incentives to innovate decline—lowering the long run growth rate.},

We explore this question in the context of employment noncompetes, using nationally representative data for 11,500 labor force participants.

Decomposing mobility into job offer generation and acceptance, we detect no evidence of differences in job search, recruitment, or offer activity associated with noncompetes. Rather, we find that employees with noncompetes—even in states that do not enforce them—frequently point to their noncompete as an important reason for declining offers from competitors. Our data further show that these employees’ beliefs about the likelihood of a lawsuit or legal enforcement are important predictors of their citing a noncompete as a factor in their decision to decline competitor offers.},

Numerous state legislatures are reconsidering their noncompete policies, however the empirical research remains fractured and ambiguous on several key issues. We begin by discussing the various theoretical perspectives in the relevant legal literature. We then carefully evaluate 24 empirical studies focusing on noncompetes (6 utilizing evidence of workers who signed a noncompete, 3 with data on the intra-firm use of noncompetes, 2 experimentally allocating noncompetes, and 14 focused on ad hoc measures of noncompete enforceability, which examine how policy differences affect workers, firms, and regions). Despite the rapidly expanding empirical literature, we argue that many of the most basic questions regarding the use and consequences of noncompetes remain either entirely unanswered or at least unsettled. We conclude that major gaps remain in the research and then provide recommendations for future research efforts to provide a solid foundation for evaluating the recent calls for banning or reforming longstanding noncompete policies at the state and now the federal level.},

Hence, firms’ project selection is independent of firm size, which can lead to scale-independent growth. This mechanism results in invariant firm-size distributions that resemble the data.},

We investigate the parent-progeny knowledge transfer relationship, and the impact of this congenital learning on the evolution and performance of a spin-out (an entrepreneurial venture by an ex-employee). Using data from the disk drive industry, we show that incumbent knowledge capabilities, related to technology and market pioneering, predict spin-out formation. Parent's capabilities at the time of spin-out founding positively affect spin-out knowledge capabilities, and result in spin-outs having higher probabilities of survival relative to other entrants.},

Because the loss of key members (defined as top decision makers) to competing firms may amount to a replication of a firm’s higher-order routines, we investigate the conditions under which interfirm mobility triggers transfer of routines across organizational boundaries. We examine membership lists pertinent to the Dutch accounting industry to study key member exits and firm dissolutions over the period 1880–1986. We exploit information on the type of membership migration (individual versus collective) and the competitive saliency of the destination firm as inferred from the recipient status (incumbent versus start-up) and its geographic location (same versus different province). The dissolution risk is highest when collective interfirm mobility results in a new venture within the same geographic area. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed.},

The model is a version of the Schumpeterian theory of firm evolution and growth developed by Klette and Kortum (2004) extended to allow for firm heterogeneity. The data set is a panel of Danish firms that includes information on value added, employment, and wages. The model's fit is good. The estimated model implies that more productive firms in each cohort grow faster and consequently crowd out less productive firms in steady state. This selection effect accounts for 53\% of aggregate growth in the estimated version of the model.},

The latter concept leads to a discussion of modeling of the spillover effects of R\&D and to suggestions for possible measurement of such effects via the concept of technological distance between firms and industries. Somewhat more familiar econometric problems (multicollinearity and simultaneity) are taken up in the next section and another section is devoted to estimation and inference problems arising more specifically in the R\&D context. Several recent studies of returns to R\&D are then surveyed, and the paper concludes with a plea for a lowering of expectations as to what the available data can tell us and with suggestions for ways of expanding the current data base in this field.},

Trend increases in productivity reinforced by process innovation are an important source of reduction of employment requirements for a given output, but the growth of demand for the old products tends to overcompensate these displacement effects. The switch of production towards new products does not reduce employment requirements, and the growth of the demand for the new products is the strongest force behind employment creation. Reallocation due to business stealing is estimated at a maximum of one third of the net employment created by product innovators. The growth of employment originated from the market expansion induced by the new products can be as important as another third.},

	abstract = {Growth in this model is driven by technological change that arises from intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents. The distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it is a nonrival, partially excludable good. Because of the nonconvexity introduced by a nonrival good, price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth.},
