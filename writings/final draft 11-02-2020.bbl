    We extend the basic Schumpeterian endogenous growth model by allowing
  incumbents to undertake innovations to improve their products, while entrants
  engage in more “radical” innovations to replace incumbents. Our model
  provides a tractable framework for the analysis of growth driven by both
  entry of new firms and productivity improvements by continuing firms. The
  model generates a non-degenerate equilibrium firm size distribution driven by
  entry of new firms and expansion exit of existing firms. When there is also
  costly imitation preventing any sector from falling too far below the
  average, the stationary firm size distribution is Pareto with an exponent
  approximately equal to one (the so-called “Zipf distribution”).%

    We build a model of firm-level innovation, productivity growth, and
  reallocation featuring endogenous entry and exit. A new and central economic
  force is the selection between high- and low-type firms, which differ in
  terms of their innovative capacity. We estimate the parameters of the model
  using {US} Census microdata on firm-level output, R\&D, and patenting. The
  model provides a good fit to the dynamics of firm entry and exit, output, and
  R\&D. Taxing the continued operation of incumbents can lead to sizable gains
  (of the order of 1.4 percent improvement in welfare) by encouraging exit of
  less productive firms and freeing up skilled labor to be used for R\&D by
  high-type incumbents. Subsidies to the R\&D of incumbents do not achieve this
  objective because they encourage the survival and expansion of low-type
  firms.%

    This paper examines the role of knowledge as a driver of an organization's

  investigate the parent-progeny knowledge transfer relationship, and the
  impact of this congenital learning on the evolution and performance of a
  spin-out (an entrepreneurial venture by an ex-employee). Using data from the
  disk drive industry, we show that incumbent knowledge capabilities, related
  to technology and market pioneering, predict spin-out formation. Parent's
  capabilities at the time of spin-out founding positively affect spin-out
  knowledge capabilities, and result in spin-outs having higher probabilities
  of survival relative to other entrants.%

    Our study examines the mediating effect of spin-out team characteristics on
  the relationship between founder quality and parent and spin-out performance.
  Since the ability to transfer or recreate complementary assets is a critical
  determinant of performance, we theorize and show that founders with greater
  ability impact both parent firm and spin-out performance by assembling teams
  that represent strong complementary human capital. Using linked
  employee-employer {US} Census data from the legal services industry, we find
  founding team size and tenure mediate the founder quality effect. Our
  findings have practical implications for both managers of existing firms and
  aspiring founders as it relates to their human resource strategies: the
  factor most salient to performance is not the individual quality per se, but
  the manner inwhich it impacts the transfer and spillover of complementary
  human capital.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    [A model of endogenous growth is developed in which vertical innovations,
  generated by a competitive research sector, constitute the underlying source
  of growth. Equilibrium is determined by a forward-looking difference
  equation, according to which the amount of research in any period depends
  upon the expected amount of research next period. One source of this
  intertemporal relationship is creative destruction. That is, the prospect of
  more future research discourages current research by threatening to destroy
  the rents created by current research. The paper analyzes the positive and
  normative properties of stationary equilibria, in which research employment
  is constant and {GNP} follows a random walk with drift, although under some
  circumstances cyclical equilibria also exist. Both the average growth rate
  and the variance of the growth rate are increasing functions of the size of
  innovations, the size of the skilled labor force, and the productivity of
  research as measured by a parameter indicating the effect of research on the
  Poisson arrival rate of innovations; and decreasing functions of the rate of
  time preference of the representative individual. Under laissez faire the
  economy's growth rate may be more or less than optimal because, in addition
  to the appropriability and intertemporal spillover effects of other
  endogenous growth models, which tend to make growth slower than optimal, the
  model also has effects that work in the opposite direction. In particular,
  the fact that private research firms do not internalize the destruction of
  rents generated by their innovations introduces a business-stealing effect
  similar to that found in the partial-equilibrium patent race literature. When
  we endogenize the size of innovations we find that business stealing also
  makes innovations too small.]%

    We analyze the problem faced by a financially weak independent inventor

  negotiating a contingent contract (with a buyer) prior to revealing the
  invention or, alternatively, the inventor can reveal the invention and then

  appropriate a sizable share of the market value of the invention by adopting

    [We examine the incentive problem confronting a firm and employee when the
  employee privately discovers a significant invention and faces a choice
  between keeping the invention private and leaving the firm to form a new
  company (start-up), or transferring knowledge and attempting to gain
  compensation from the firm (spin-off). We focus on inventions that require
  little start-up capital and for which property rights are either missing or
  very weak. In such settings, the employee will sometimes form a new company
  even though joint profits would have been greater had the invention been
  developed with the original firm. We also identify when the firm has an
  incentive to pay a substantial sum to the employee via a spin-off, thereby
  deterring a start-up. Finally, the basic analysis is applied to examine
  several issues including specific versus general innovations, trade secret
  law, and legal "shop rights."]%

    This paper studies how corporate research and development (R\&D) investment
  affects labor mobility. We use employer-employee matched data in ordinary
  least squares and instrumental variables analyses to assess four hypotheses.
  R\&D has no effect on worker retention, exit from employment, or mobility to
  incumbent firms. Instead, it increases employee departures to
  entrepreneurship, leading employees to join the founding teams of startups
  that are venture capital-backed, high tech, high wage, and in different
  sectors than the parent firm. These highgrowth, high-risk startups emerging
  from R\&D benefit from a focused, standalone incentive structure and have
  poor complementarities to the parent firm’s assets.%

    We study the relationship between the enforceability of covenants not to
  compete ({CNCs}) and employee mobility and wages. We exploit a 2015 {CNC} ban
  for technology workers in Hawaii and find that this ban increased mobility by
  11\% and new-hire wages by 4\%. We supplement the Hawaii evaluation with a
  cross-state analysis using matched employer-employee data. We find that eight
  years after starting a job in an average-enforceability state, technology
  workers have about 8\% fewer jobs and 4.6\% lower cumulative earnings
  relative to equivalent workers starting in a non-enforcing state. These
  results are consistent with {CNC} enforceability increasing monopsony power.%

    Labor market policies, such as non-compete laws ({NCL}), may significantly
  affect entrepreneur- ship, innovation and productivity growth. I study the
  effect of {NCL} on the creation of employee spinouts (firms created by former
  employees of incumbent firms) and the implications of this process for
  aggregate productivity growth. The process of spinout formation introduces a
  nontrivial tradeoff between growth-enhancing knowledge diffusion in the form
  of new produc- tive firms, on the one hand, and the threat of knowledge
  dissemination and competition that harms innovation by incumbents, on the
  other hand. I use patents and inventors’ data to iden- tify spinout
  entrants and empirically explore their characteristics. I document that 1)
  they outperform regular entrants with no prior experience, 2) spinouts are
  more likely to separate from more innovative firms, 3) more productive firms
  spawn better spinouts, and 4) states with weaker {NCL} have higher rates of
  spinout entry. To analyze the interaction between incumbents innovation
  incentives and spinout entry, I develop a dynamic general equilibrium
  endogenous growth model consistent with empirical facts from the data. After
  calibrating the parameters of the model, I quantify the importance for growth
  of the two above-mentioned channels. I then quantitatively investigate the
  implications of different non-compete policies. I find that it is welfare
  improving to abolish existing non-compete restrictions; however, the policy
  protecting firms with high technological leadership is growth-maximizing.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Covenants not to compete (“noncompetes” or “{CNCs}”) are an
  increasingly controversial element of the U.S. employer–employee
  relationship. Numerous state legislatures are reconsidering their noncompete
  policies, however the empirical research remains fractured and ambiguous on
  several key issues. We begin by discussing the various theoretical
  perspectives in the relevant legal literature. We then carefully evaluate 24
  empirical studies focusing on noncompetes (6 utilizing evidence of workers
  who signed a noncompete, 3 with data on the intra-firm use of noncompetes, 2
  experimentally allocating noncompetes, and 14 focused on ad hoc measures of
  noncompete enforceability, which examine how policy differences affect
  workers, firms, and regions). Despite the rapidly expanding empirical
  literature, we argue that many of the most basic questions regarding the use
  and consequences of noncompetes remain either entirely unanswered or at least
  unsettled. We conclude that major gaps remain in the research and then
  provide recommendations for future research efforts to provide a solid
  foundation for evaluating the recent calls for banning or reforming
  longstanding noncompete policies at the state and now the federal level.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The impact of R\&D on growth through spillovers has been a major topic of
  economic research over the last thirty years. A central problem in the
  literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing
  “spillovers” : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers
  and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We
  develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and
  implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space
  and productmarket space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that
  technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social
  returns to R\&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We
  identify the causal effect of R\&D spillovers by using changes in federal and
  state tax incentives for R\&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower
  social returns to R\&D because they operate more in technological niches.
  Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and
  how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to
  these criteria.%

    We theorize that the value provided by the firm's complementary assets has
  important implications for the exit decisions of employees and their
  subsequent effects on the firm's performance. Using linked employee-employer
  data from the U.S. Census Bureau on legal services, we find that employees
  with higher earnings are less likely to leave relative to employees with
  lower earnings, but if they do, are more likely to create a new venture than
  join another firm. Employee entrepreneurship has a larger adverse impact on
  source firm performance than moves to established firms, even controlling for
  observable employee quality. Our findings suggest that in knowledge intensive
  settings, managers should focus on tailoring compensation packages to help
  minimize the adverse impact of employee entrepreneurship, particularly among
  high performing individuals. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.%

    [We present a theory of entry through spinoffs where workers generate ideas
  and possess private information concerning their quality. Because quality is
  privately observed, adverse selection implies that the market can only offer
  a price that reflects the average quality of ideas sold. Only workers with
  good ideas decide to spin off, whereas workers with mediocre ideas sell them.
  Existing firms pay a price for ideas sold in the market that implies zero
  expected profits. Hence, firms' project selection is independent of firm
  size, which can lead to scale-independent growth. This mechanism results in
  invariant firm-size distributions that resemble the data.]%

    In this article I evaluate the contribution of R\&D investments to
  productivity growth. The basis for the analysis are the free entry condition
  and the fact that most R\&D innovations are embodied. Free entry yields a
  relationship between the resources devoted to R\&D and the growth rate of
  technology. Since innovators are small, this relationship is not directly
  affected by the size of R\&D externalities, or the presence of aggregate
  diminishing returns in R\&D after controlling for the growth rate of output
  and the interest rate. The embodiment of R\&D-driven innovations bounds the
  size of the production externalities. The resulting contribution of R\&D to
  productivity growth in the {US} is smaller than 3-5 tenths of 1\% point. This
  constitutes an upper bound for the case where innovators internalize the
  consequences of their R\&D investments on the cost of conducting future
  innovations. From a normative perspective, this analysis implies that, if the
  innovation technology takes the form assumed in the literature, the actual
  {US} R\&D intensity may be the socially optimal.%

    This study investigates the impact of non-competition agreements on the
  type of R\&D activity undertaken by companies. Non-competition agreements, by
  reducing outbound mobility and knowledge leakages to competitors, make
  high-risk R\&D projects relatively more valuable than low-risk ones. Thus,
  they induce companies to choose riskier R\&D projects, such that corporate
  inventions are more likely to lie in the tails of the inventions' value
  distribution (as breakthroughs or failures) and be in novel technological
  areas. This study uses data about U.S. patent applications from 1990 to 2000
  and considers longitudinal variation in the enforcement of non-compete
  clauses. The results indicate that in states with stricter enforcement,
  companies undertake riskier R\&D paths than in states that do not enforce
  non-compete agreements as strictly. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

    Conventional wisdom among legal scholars is that contractual restrictions
  on employee mobility affect turnover and led to the overtaking of
  Massachusetts' Route 128 by Silicon Valley. We study a model of employee
  mobility in the spirit of Pakes and Nitzan to see when this can be the case.
  We show that, in fact, with certain frictions taken into account, a model of
  employee mobility can not only replicate the overtaking by Silicon Valley,
  but it can also help to explain Route 128s early dominance. Further, the
  model explains the relative success of firms that start as, or generate,
  spin-outs.%

    A power law ({PL}) is the form taken by a large number of surprising
  empirical regularities in economics and finance. This review surveys
  well-documented empirical {PLs} regarding income and wealth, the size of
  cities and firms, stock market returns, trading volume, international trade,
  and executive pay. It reviews detailindependent theoretical motivations that
  make sharp predictions concerning the existence and coefficients of {PLs},
  without requiring delicate tuning of model parameters. These theoretical
  mechanisms include random growth, optimization, and the economics of
  superstars, coupled with extreme value theory. Some empirical regularities
  currently lack an appropriate explanation. This article highlights these open

    Entrants and incumbents can create new products and displace the products
  of competitors. Incumbents can also improve their existing products. How much
  of aggregate productivity growth occurs through each of these channels? Using
  data from the U.S. Longitudinal Business Database on all nonfarm private
  businesses from 1983 to 2013, we arrive at three main conclusions: First,
  most growth appears to come from incumbents. We infer this from the modest
  employment share of entering ﬁrms (deﬁned as those less than 5 years
  old). Second, most growth seems to occur through improvements of existing
  varieties rather than creation of brand new varieties. Third, own-product
  improvements by incumbents appear to be more important than creative
  destruction. We infer this because the distribution of job creation and
  destruction has thinner tails than implied by a model with a dominant role
  for creative destruction.%

    We examine two views of the creation of venture-backed start-ups, or
  “entrepreneurial spawning.” In one, young firms prepare employees for
  entrepreneurship, educating them about the process, and exposing them to
  relevant networks. In the other, individuals become entrepreneurs when large
  bureaucratic employers do not fund their ideas. Controlling for firm size,
  patents, and industry, the most prolific spawners are originally
  venture-backed companies located in Silicon Valley and Massachusetts.
  Undiversified firms spawn more firms. Silicon Valley, Massachusetts, and
  originally venture-backed firms typically spawn firms only peripherally
  related to their core businesses. Overall, entrepreneurial learning and
  networks appear important in creating venture-backed firms.%

    This article outlines the production function approach to the estimation of
  the returns to R\&D and then proceeds to discuss in turn two very difficult
  problems: the measurement of output in R\&D intensive industries and the
  definition and measurement of the stock of R\&D "capital." The latter concept
  leads to a discussion of modeling of the spillover effects of R\&D and to
  suggestions for possible measurement of such effects via the concept of
  technological distance between firms and industries. Somewhat more familiar
  econometric problems (multicollinearity and simultaneity) are taken up in the
  next section and another section is devoted to estimation and inference
  problems arising more specifically in the R\&D context. Several recent
  studies of returns to R\&D are then surveyed, and the paper concludes with a
  plea for a lowering of expectations as to what the available data can tell us
  and with suggestions for ways of expanding the current data base in this
  field.%

    R\&D spillovers are, potentially, a major source of endogenous growth in

    [We develop a model of repeated product improvements in a continuum of
  sectors. Each product follows a stochastic progression up a quality ladder.
  Progress is not uniform across sectors, so an equilibrium distribution of
  qualities evolves over time. But the rate of aggregate growth is constant.
  The growth rate responds to profit incentives in the R\&D sector. We explore
  the welfare properties of our model. Then we relate our approach to an
  alternative one that views product innovation as a process of generating an
  ever-expanding range of horizontally differentiated products. Finally, we
  apply the model to issues of resource accumulation and international trade.]%

    We review the econometric literature on measuring the returns to R\&D. The

  extensive discussion of measurement and econometric issues that arise when
  estimating the models. We then provide a series of tables summarizing the
  major results that have been obtained and conclude with a presentation of

  measured in many cases.%

    We study the impact of process and product innovations introduced by firms
  on employment growth with random samples of manufacturing and services from
  France, Germany, Spain and the {UK} for 1998–2000, totaling about 20,000
  companies. We develop and estimate a model relating firms' and industry's
  employment to innovation, that leads us to the conclusions that follow. Trend
  increases in productivity reinforced by process innovation are an important
  source of reduction of employment requirements for a given output, but the
  growth of demand for the old products tends to overcompensate these
  displacement effects. The switch of production towards new products does not
  reduce employment requirements, and the growth of the demand for the new
  products is the strongest force behind employment creation. Reallocation due
  to business stealing is estimated at a maximum of one third of the net
  employment created by product innovators. The growth of employment originated
  from the market expansion induced by the new products can be as important as
  another third.%

    I investigate the impact of restricting labor mobility on two components of
  growth: entrepreneurship and capital investment. To identify the mechanism, I
  combine {LinkedIn}'s database of employment histories with staggered changes
  in the enforceability of non-compete agreements that come mostly from court
  rulings. Stronger enforceability leads to a substantial decline in employee
  departures, especially in knowledge-intensive occupations, and reduces
  entrepreneurship in corresponding sectors. However, these shocks increase the
  investment rate at existing knowledge-intensive fi rms. The estimates in my
  sample suggest that, in such sectors, there is roughly \$1.8 million of
  additional capital investment from publicly-held fi rms for every lost new
  firm entry.%

    Is there too much or too little research and development (R\&D)? In this
  paper we bridge the gap between the recent growth literature and the
  empirical productivity literature. We derive in a growth model the
  relationship between the social rate of return to R\&D and the coefficient
  estimates of the empirical literature and show that these estimates represent
  a lower bound. Furthermore, our analytic framework provides a direct mapping
  from the rate of return to the degree of underinvestment in research.
  Conservative estimates suggest that optimal R\&D investment is at least two
  to four times actual investment.%

    Entry by spinoffs from incumbent firms is investigated for the laser
  industry. A model in which spinoffs exploit knowledge from their parents is
  constructed to explain the market conditions conducive to spinoffs, the types
  of firms that spawn spinoffs, and the relationship of spinoffs to their
  parents. The model is tested using detailed data on all laser entrants from
  the start of the industry through 1994. Our findings support the basic
  premise of the model that spinoffs inherit knowledge from their parents that
  shapes their nature at birth. Implications of our findings for organizational
  behavior, business strategy, entry and industry evolution, and technological

    A growing empirical literature on spinoff formation has begun to reveal
  some striking regularities about which firms are most likely to spawn
  spinoffs, when they are most likely to spawn them, and the relationship
  between the quality of the parent firm and its spinoffs. Deeper
  investigations into the causes of spinoffs have highlighted the importance of
  strategic disagreements in driving some employees to resign and found a new
  venture. Motivated by this literature, we construct a new theory of spinoff
  formation driven by strategic disagreements and explore how well it explains
  the emerging empirical regularities.%

    We develop a parsimonious model of innovation to confront firm‐level
  evidence. It captures the dynamics of individual heterogeneous firms,
  describes the behavior of an industry with firm entry and exit, and delivers
  a general equilibrium model of technological change. While unifying the
  theoretical analysis of firms, industries, and the aggregate economy, the
  model yields insights into empirical work on innovating firms. It accounts
  for the persistence of firms’ R\&D investment, the concentration of R\&D
  among incumbents, the link between R\&D and patenting, and why R\&D as a
  fraction of revenues is positively correlated with firm productivity but not
  with firm size or growth.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Productivity differences across firms are large and persistent, but the
  evidence for worker reallocation as an important source of aggregate
  productivity growth is mixed. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the
  structure of an equilibrium model of growth through innovation designed to
  identify and quantify the role of resource reallocation in the growth
  process. The model is a version of the Schumpeterian theory of firm evolution
  and growth developed by Klette and Kortum (2004) extended to allow for firm
  heterogeneity. The data set is a panel of Danish firms that includes
  information on value added, employment, and wages. The model's fit is good.
  The estimated model implies that more productive firms in each cohort grow
  faster and consequently crowd out less productive firms in steady state. This
  selection effect accounts for 53\% of aggregate growth in the estimated
  version of the model.%

    A growing body of research has documented the local impact of employee
  non-compete agreements, but their effect on interstate migration patterns
  remains unexplored. Exploiting an inadvertent policy reversal in Michigan as
  a natural experiment, we show that non-compete agreements are responsible for
  a “brain drain” of knowledge workers out of states that enforce such
  contracts to states where they are not enforceable. Importantly, this effect
  is felt most strongly on the margin of workers who are more collaborative and
  whose work is more impactful.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Whereas a number of studies have considered the implications of employee
  mobility, comparatively little research has considered institutional factors
  governing the ability of employees to move from one firm to another. This
  paper explores a legal constraint on mobility—employee non-compete
  agreements—by exploiting Michigan's apparently inadvertent 1985 reversal of
  its non-compete enforcement policy as a natural experiment. Using a
  differences-in-differences approach, and controlling for changes in the auto
  industry central to Michigan's economy, we find that the enforcement of
  non-competes indeed attenuates mobility. Moreover, non-compete enforcement
  decreases mobility more sharply for inventors with firm-specific skills and
  for those who specialize in narrow technical fields. The results speak to the
  literature on employee mobility while offering a credibly exogenous source of
  variation that can extend previous research on the implications of such
  mobility.%

    We gauge the prevalence and performance of firms founded as employee
  spinoffs, relative to other new firms with and without parents, and relative
  to diversification ventures of existing firms entering new industries. Using
  a comprehensive linked employer–employee database from Brazil for the
  universe of formal firms during the period 1995–2001, we are able to
  identify an employee spinoff either when the director/manager moved from a
  parent in the same industry or when one-quarter of the employees shifted from
  a common parent. Depending on definition, employee spinoffs account for
  between one-sixth and one-third of the new firms in Brazil's private sector
  during this period. Regardless of definition, size at entry is larger for
  employee spinoffs than for new firms without parents but smaller than for
  diversification ventures of existing firms. Similarly, survival rates for
  employee spinoffs are higher than for new firms without parents and
  comparable to those for diversification ventures of existing firms. These
  results suggest that we can think of some part of a firm's productivity and
  riskiness as embodied in the firm's employees and portable.%

    Growth in this model is driven by technological change that arises from
  intentional investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents. The
  distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that it is neither a
  conventional good nor a public good; it is a nonrival, partially excludable
  good. Because of the nonconvexity introduced by a nonrival good, price-taking
  competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with
  monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human
  capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is
  devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will
  increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient
  to generate growth.%

    Using a panel of U.S. metropolitan areas, we find that increases in the
  supply of venture capital positively affect firm starts, employment, and
  aggregate income. Our results remain robust to a variety of specifications,
  including ones that address endogeneity. The estimated magnitudes imply that
  venture capital stimulates the creation of more firms than it funds, which
  appears consistent with two mechanisms: First, would-be entrepreneurs
  anticipating financing needs more likely start firms when the supply of
  capital expands. Second, funded companies may transfer know-how to their
  employees, thereby enabling spin-offs, and may encourage others to become
  entrepreneurs through demonstration effects.%

    This paper assesses the aggregate e↵ect of non-competition employment
  contracts, agreements that exclude employees from joining competing firms for
  a duration of time, in the managerial labor market. These contracts encourage
  firm investment but restrict manager mobility. To explore this tradeo↵, I
  develop a dynamic contracting model in which firms use non-competition to
  enforce buyout payment when their managers are poached, ultimately extracting
  rent from outside firms. Such rent extraction encour- ages initial employing
  firms to undertake more investment, as they partially capture the external
  payo↵, but distorts manager allocation. I show that the privately-optimal
  contract over-extracts rent by setting an excessively long non-competition
  duration. Therefore, restrictions on non-competition can improve efficiency.
  To quantitatively evaluate the theory, I assemble a new dataset on
  non-competition contracts for ex- ecutives in U.S. public firms. Using the
  contract data, I find that executives under non-competition are associated
  with a lower separation rate and higher firm invest- ment. I also provide new
  empirical evidence consistent with non-competition reducing wage-backloading
  in the model. The calibrated model suggests that the optimal re- striction on
  non-competition duration is close to banning non-competition.%

    This study examines the effect of noncompete enforceability on training and
  wages. An increase from non-enforcement to mean enforceability is associated
  with a 14\% increase in training, which tends to be firm-sponsored and
  designed to upgrade or teach new skills. In contrast to theoretical
  expectations, the results show no evidence of a relationship between
  noncompete enforceability and self-sponsored training. Despite the increases
  in training, an increase from non-enforcement to mean enforceability is
  associated with a 4\% decrease in hourly wages. Consistent with reduced
  bargaining power, noncompete enforceability is associated with a reduction in
  the return to tenure, and less educated workers experience additional wage
  losses in the face of increased enforceability relative to more educated
  workers. Suggestive evidence indicates that consideration policies exhibit
  differential effects relative to other types of noncompete policies.%

    This paper examines how the enforceability of noncompete covenants aﬀects
  the creation, growth, and survival of spinouts and other new entrants. The
  impact of noncompete enforceability on new ﬁrms is ambiguous, since
  noncompetes reduce knowledge leakage but impose hiring costs. However, we
  posit that enforceability screens formation of within-industry spinouts
  ({WSOs}) relative to non-{WSOs} by dissuading founders with lower human
  capital. Using data on 5.5 million new ﬁrms, we ﬁnd greater
  enforceability is associated with fewer {WSOs}, but relative to non-{WSOs},
  {WSOs} that are created tend to start and stay larger, are founded by
  higher-earners, and are more likely to survive their initial years. In
  contrast, we ﬁnd no impact on non-{WSO} entry and a negative eﬀect on
  size and short-term survival.%

    Using nationally representative survey data on 11,505 labor force
  participants, we examine the use, implementation, and labor market outcomes
  associated with noncompete agreements. Nearly 1 in 5 labor force participants
  were bound by noncompetes in 2014, and nearly 40\% had signed at least one
  noncompete in the past. Noncompetes are more likely to be found in
  high-skill, high-paying jobs, but they are also common in low-skill,
  low-paying jobs as well as in states that do not enforce them. Less than 10\%
  of employees negotiate over their noncompetes and roughly one-third of
  noncompetes are signed after applicants have already accepted their job
  offers (but not with a raise or promotion). Differences in the timing of the
  noncompete are associated with different outcomes: those presented with a
  noncompete before accepting the associated job offer earn 9.7\% higher wages,
  receive 11\% more training, and are 6.6\% more satisfied in their job than
  those not bound by noncompetes. However, those asked to sign after accepting
  the job offer are 12.5\% less satisfied in their job and experience no wage
  and training benefits. We conclude that noncompetes may be efficient
  contracting tools, but that they can also serve as intertemporal conduits of
  monopsony power.%

    Do contracts influence behavior independent of the law governing their
  enforceability? We explore this question in the context of employment
  noncompetes, using nationally representative data for 11,500 labor force
  participants. We show that noncompetes are associated with reductions in
  employee mobility and changes in the direction of that mobility (i.e., toward
  noncompetitors) in both states that do and do not enforce noncompetes.
  Decomposing mobility into job offer generation and acceptance, we detect no
  evidence of differences in job search, recruitment, or offer activity
  associated with noncompetes. Rather, we find that employees with
  noncompetes—even in states that do not enforce them—frequently point to
  their noncompete as an important reason for declining offers from
  competitors. Our data further show that these employees’ beliefs about the
  likelihood of a lawsuit or legal enforcement are important predictors of
  their citing a noncompete as a factor in their decision to decline competitor
  offers.%

    [In this paper, we examine the ecological consequences of initial public
  offerings ({IPOs}) and acquisitions, specifically how the spatial
  distribution of these events influences the location-specific founding rates
  of new companies. We explore whether relatively small spatial units
  (metropolitan statistical areas) in close geographic proximity to firms that
  recently have been acquired or experienced an {IPO} exhibit high new venture
  creation rates and whether the magnitudes of these effects depend on regional
  differences in statutes governing the freedom of employees to move between
  employers. Count models of biotechnology firm foundings establish three
  findings: (1) {IPOs} of organizations located contiguous to or within an
  {MSA} accelerate the founding rate within that {MSA}, (2) acquisitions of
  biotech firms situated near to or within an {MSA} accelerate the founding
  rate within the {MSA}, but only when the acquirer enters from outside of the
  biotech industry, and (3) the enforceability of post-employment non-compete
  covenants, which is determined at the state level, strongly moderates these
  effects.]%

    Let X(i), i∈[0; 1] be a collection of identically distributed and
  pairwise uncorrelated random variables with common finite mean μ and
  variance \${\textbackslash}sigma {\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$. This paper shows
  the law of large numbers, i.e. the fact that
  \${\textbackslash}int\_\{0\}{\textasciicircum}\{1\}X(i)di={\textbackslash}mu
  \$. It does so by interpreting the integral as a Pettis-integral. Studying
  Riemann sums, the paper first provides a simple proof involving no more than
  the calculation of variances, and demonstrates, that the measurability
  problem pointed out by Judd (1985) is avoided by requiring convergence in
  mean square rather than convergence almost everywhere. We raise the issue of
  when a random continuum economy is a good abstraction for a large finite
  economy and give an example in which it is not.%

    This paper examines the competitive consequences of interfirm mobility.
  Because the loss of key members (defined as top decision makers) to competing
  firms may amount to a replication of a firm’s higher-order routines, we
  investigate the conditions under which interfirm mobility triggers transfer
  of routines across organizational boundaries. We examine membership lists
  pertinent to the Dutch accounting industry to study key member exits and firm
  dissolutions over the period 1880–1986. We exploit information on the type
  of membership migration (individual versus collective) and the competitive
  saliency of the destination firm as inferred from the recipient status
  (incumbent versus start-up) and its geographic location (same versus
  different province). The dissolution risk is highest when collective
  interfirm mobility results in a new venture within the same geographic area.
  The theoretical implications of this study are discussed.%
