#
# Purpose:
#
# The purpose of this script is to compute rates of 
# going public for spinouts and regular entrants in the dataset
#
# This involves two calculations:
#
# (1) Calculating the fraction of public firms which 
# became public that year (how exactly to measure?)
#
#
# (2) 
#     (a) How many are covered by my dataset? 
#     (b) What fraction of those covered are spinouts?
#
# The answer to (2)(a) is just good to know. 
# The answer to (2)(b) is what I should calibrate the model to
