Main idea: hard to control for what causes all of the differences, but we
 can argue with a model that the *causal* effects found in the Michigan
 experiment could result from spillovers.
 The idea is, write a model where there is some force that governs both
 migration decisions of inventors corresponding to those in the Michigan
 experiment, and the other relevant spillovers that I want to account for.
 This force is something like

\begin_layout Section*
Big picture:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Project goal: estimate welfare effects of non-compete enforcement, optimal
 enforcement policy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Contribution: an answer to the question above that can exploit use of, in
 a plausible way, the differences in outcomes across enforcement regimes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In order to do this, estimate a model of the effects of non-compete enforcement
 on welfare.
 Need a model for this because we cannot measure welfare directly.
 Call these parameters 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

non-compete tradeoff parameters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In order to estimate, need to control for the effect of state characteristics
 on data used to estimate non-compete tradeoff parameters.
 Variety of ways to accomplish this.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Migration story important to the extent that we do not fully observe characteris
tics of workforce in each state; helps us to proxy for this (i.e.
 shows us

\begin_layout Itemize
Decomposition allows for consistent estimation of structural parameters
 governing the tradeoffs involved in non-compete enforcement
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Non-enforcing regions exhibiting more business formation in response to
 exogenous increases in supply of VC funding will then be explained by there
 being smarter people / more entrepreneurs in California, rather than non-enforc
ement being better for business dynamism.
 Similary for other measures of business dynamism / worker welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that we still need to solve the problem of identifying the non-compete
 tradeff parameters in a closed economy.

Use estimated structural model to analyze optimal policy.

Future possibilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The above assumes that the outcomes in a state can be thought of as a function
 of state characteristics, which can then be estimated using actual data
 enhanced with migration flow data (and the results of Marx etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Outline of Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Some empirical facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
California has more tech employment, more tech startups, more job mobility,
 more innovation.
 California does not enforce non-competes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Originally, tech employment / startups were concentrated in Massachusetts
 (which does enforce), but over time they moved to California (which does
 not enforce).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Non-enforcing regions exhibit more business formation in response to exogenous
 increases in supply of VC funding (Samila-Sorenson).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
California (and non-enforcing states more generally) pay the same worker-jobs
 higher NPV of wages, and a different time-profile of wages (Balasubramaniam
 et al.
 2017)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
More enforcement, but conditional on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

requiring consideration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, increases firm training of workers without reducing average wages (Starr
 2017, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Consider this: ...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Enforcement of non-competes leads to more emigration of knowledge workers
 towards non-enforcing states (Marx).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Enforcement of non-competes leads to less worker mobility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Should I allow non-competes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do these facts imply that all states should reduce their enforcement of
 non-competes to California's level?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Three questions:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Do I believe that the above has really uncovered the causal effect of non-compet
e enforcement (not accounting for spillovers).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
E.g.
 do I believe (3) is truly 
\emph on
because 
\emph default
they are non-enforcing?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Could there be spillovers? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The original motivation for my project: of course I believe (7) because
 it is identified from an exogenous shift in policy.
 But couldn't it be that this is only because entrepreneurs, inventors,
 and other high-tech workers relocated to non-enforcing regions (e.g.
 California), as documented in (6)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Can also be applied to the other results, e.g.
 could (3) be because non-enforcing regions attract the best talent? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
I want to decompose the causal effect of non-compete enforcement into the
 direct effect on the region and the effect from spillovers.
 How to do this decomposition, given that I only have one data point? 
\series bold
A model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The game is: can I write a reasonable model in which 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The microeconometric results above hold, e.g.
 (3)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The effects of spillovers - entrepreneurs, workers, etc.
 moving to non-enforcing regions - are such that (i) does not necessarily
 imply that the non-enforcing state has the better aggregate policy.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
For (1) and (2) for example this model would be a model showing the non-enforcin
g region overtaking the enforcing region.
 Adding (6) and (7), we'd need the model to generate some of the differences
 through migration of inventors.
 (5),(6) suggests a model where workers are being tricked into signing non-compe
tes and losing some of their surplus as a result.
 (3) is harder to justify: I need an explanation for why non-enforcing regions
 spawn more businesses / employment when there is randomly more VC funding,
 that either (1) relies on some kind of spillover, or (2) somehow isn't
 a sign that the economy is better.
 Could be a creative destruction story - without enforcement, there is excessive
 creative destruction.
 You'd expect to see more response to VC funding, since it funds startups
 mostly, but this is not necessarily good for welfare (since they're just
 business-stealing).
 Of course this has predictions of its own that could be tested with more
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Important note: 
\series default
distinguish between finding effect of migration, and finding effect of migration
 due to non-compete enforcement.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If I resolve all of these problems, what can I conclude about welfare?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Workers' wage profiles probably summarize their welfare
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But what about firm profits? These are affected by creative destruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And consumer welfare? This is affected by the resulting growth rate, which
 depends on the amount of innovation that occurs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If I had results, purged of the contribution from spillovers, about the
 effect of enforcement on the above 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sufficient statistics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for welfare, then we'd be done.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If I think mechanisms are causal...
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(1) is close but not quite enough on its own because I don't know the welfare
 effects - e.g.
 what happens to wages (hence inequality between workers and firms), creative
 destruction, other stuff i can't think of right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(2) is a similar fact to (1): California overtook vs.
 California has more.
 So it doesn't really add much to the question of optimal policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(3) gives us another sense in which these places are more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dynamic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hence tells us something about innovation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(4) tells us something about wages hence worker welfare
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
...but really, should I think these mechanisms are causal?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(1) on its own is not very compelling, because there could be other factors
 influencing - maybe California is more innovative because of other policies,
 institutions, demographics, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(2), being a similar fact to (1), doesn't add much, but there are arguments
 one could make.
 People have written models in which the non-enforcing state starts off
 with fewer firms and less economic activity, and later overtakes the the
 enforcing state.
 So (2) is at least plausibly causal.
 And if no other California characteristics have changed (and the weather
 certaintly didn't), then it's kind of the only candidate explanation.
 However, characteristics did change – population grew, Stanford grew, etc.
 all later than in Massachusetts – so it could just be that going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(3) I don't doubt their identification of the sensitivity to exogenous changes
 in supply of VC funding - that is solid IV work.
 So they can identify for each state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 the sensitivity 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 to an increase in the supply of VC funding, but they cannot test whether
 the correlation of enforcement and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 is causal or spurious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(4) I may have some issues with their work - i'm skeptical that they are
 really comparing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same worker, the same job
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 across non-compete enforcement regimes.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are some things that can be done - for example, diff-in-diff or diff-in-di
ff-in-diff designs leave you with correlations that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

less likely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be spurious.
 More below.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Let's get into more detail.
 How do I actually convince ourselves of a causal relationship between non-compe
te enforceability and some economic outcome?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose first, to simplify, that state economies were totally isolated island
 economies.
 Then I can ignore (6).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduced form approach I: if I have a bunch of islands with varying degrees
 of enforcement, and I can observe all of the other relevant characteristics,
 then I could run a cross-sectional regression like 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{i}=\alpha+\beta\times NC_{i}+\gamma\cdot X_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 indexes the island, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the relevant outcome variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $NC_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a variable encoding the strength of non-compete enforcement, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 are island characteristics that affect the outcome, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 is an error term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
More general forms, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{i}=F(NC_{i},X_{i},\varepsilon_{i};\theta)
\]

\end_inset

 e.g.
 non parametric, can be estimated if I have enough observations (and enough
 variation across the entire range of values for each observation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The problem is: I don't have enough islands, even to do the linear regression!
 At best, I have 50 states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Further problem: I don't observe the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 So I need to use proxies.
 A model could help in constructing proxies, but hard to see how it could
 be identified.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduced form approach II: exploit natural experiments.
 I can estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in the equation, or 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{NC_{i}}$
\end_inset

 in the general formulation, without all the necessary data points if I
 suppose that I observe an exogenous change in 
\begin_inset Formula $NC_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Best example of this approach is the Marx paper on the MARA in Michigan.
 For every one of the hypotheses above, one could in principle check whether
 they hold in the time series in this experiment.
 E.g., one could check (3) 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Now I can add connections between islands
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
I can put this into the previous framework by adding characteristics of
 other islands 
\begin_inset Formula $-i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To be more specific, suppose I are interested in the effect 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If innovative capacity in one state affects the RHS variables of any other
 state I have an endogeneity problem, but I will ignore this for now.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section*
What kind of model is needed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Model for an ideal dataset / dgp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose I have a good estimate / model of the effect of characteristics
 of states (population, other resources, regulations, institutions) on outcomes,
 given different levels of non-compete enforcement, and suppose that I can
 observe these differences.
 Suppose also that these differences are all that is relevant for the difference
s in outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy is the following.
 Parametrize the model using (1) characteristics of states, (2) non-compete
 enforcment policy.
 Estimate remaining parameters using the infinite data (for example, the
 ideal result of study (3) above).
 The model's estimates will be accurate because we have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

controlled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the effect of these underlying state characteristics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The data does not exist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately the above situation is impossible.
 First, I can never control entirely for all different characteristics of
 states and how they affect outcomes.
 Second, I cannot be sure I have enough data to estimate a model of the
 effect of non-compete enforcement given characteristics which includes
 all the possible tradeoffs.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It could be the case that 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 How can I solve this problem?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Just do as well as possible, noting the shortcomings: what additional data
 is needed, etc.
 There are always possible other characteristics that are relevant that
 are unobserved – this can't stop you from trying to answer the question
 by controlling for what you can control for.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose we can't fully observe the distribution of talent across states.

 workers) across regions

Model of decision to relocate: I do not observe all relocation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Problem: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
I do not want to ascribe all migration to differential enforcement of non-compet
es.
 But I do want to match the data on total migration flows, so that I can
 use results like (3) to discipline the model.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Treatment of consideration, bounded rationality: if I assume consideration
 (which is the natural assumption), outcomes will only be consistent with
 parameters biased against enforcement of non-competes - to the extent that
 lack of consideration worsens the welfare properties of enforcement.
