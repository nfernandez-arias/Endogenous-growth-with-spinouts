Non-compete Covenants: Knowledge Spillovers, Hold-ups, and Economic Growth

Introduction

There is a large literature considering the optimal enforcement of non-competes
 (for an excellent survey, see Marx & Fleming 2012).
 The tentative consensus that has emerged is that enforcement of non-competes
 is bad for workers and bad for growth.
 In fact, starting with Gilson 1999, many authors have ascribed Sililcon
 Valley's displacement of former high-tech hub Route 128 to California's
 blanket refusal to enforce such contracts.

 This story receives support from a variety of empirical papers, exploiting
 both time-series and cross-sectional variation (across US states) in the
 enforcement of non-competes.

\begin_layout Standard
One may be tempted to conclude from this body of work that non-compete agreement
s deter growth (I certainly am).
 Yet the evidence does not yet fully support this view.
 Especially in light of evidence from Marx et.
 al.
 2015 that there is brain drain from enforcing states to nonenforcing states,
 the overperformance of non-enforcing jurisdictions could simply be redistributi
on of economic activity rather than aggregate economic growth.

 More broadly, to date there has not been an aggregate welfare analysis
 using a workhorse general equilibrium macroeconomic model of long-run industry
 evolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three main questions that can in principle be answered with a
 general equilibrium model and not with the kinds of studies that have so
 far been conducted.
 First, welfare in an economy where all workers are bound by non-competes
 can be compared to welfare in an economy where non-competes are not enforced.
 Next, can we write a general equilibrium model with enforcing and non-enforcing
 regions which can reproduce the existing empirical evidence (i.e.
 brain drain causing differential performance).
 Finally, in reality, workers and jobs are heterogeneous, so that in certain
 cases non-competes have relatively more pros than cons.
 In this vein, one can ask the question: to what extent does the market
 endogenously assign / enforce non-competes to workers whose consequent
 lack of mobilty is on balance relatively less harmful to the aggregate
 economy?

\begin_layout Standard
The contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for
 conducting an analysis of the first question above.
 I develop a model based on Klette & Kortum 2004 (itself a modification
 of Hopenhayn 1992), endogenizing knowledge spillovers by way of worker
 flows.
 To perform this analysis the model must be rich enough to include the various
 decisions by employers and employees that can be distorted by the presence
 of non-competes.
 These include firm investments in R&D, firm investments in the worker's
 human capital, and employee's investments in their own human capital.
 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model, by necessity, must have many parameters or assumptions (about
 relationships between the fewer assumed parameters).
 There is no way around this.
 I will offer some guidance as to how to obtain empirical discpiline on
 these parameters.
 My hope is that the policy prescriptions to emerge from my analysis will
 depend in a clear way on certain key elasticities, which will suggest a
 future path for research to uncover these for different industries.

The paper connects three literatures: (1) the work on the contribution of
 entrants / incumbents to aggregate growth.

, Acemoglu & Cao (sp?) 201x; and (2) the work on spillovers / startups due
 to employee flows such as Franco & Filson 2006, Klepper & Sleeper, and
 others; and (3) the more general literature on industry dynamics and the
 effects on growth of changing rates of entry and reallaction (c.f.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Franco & Filson 2006 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "franco_filson2006"

\end_inset

) shows that, in a similar setup, the competitive equilibrium is Pareto
 optimal.
 The logic is essentially that spinning out is a weakly positive sum game;
 as a result, employees will be willing to take lower wages that exactly
 compensate (or even more than fully compensate) the incumbents for the
 leaking knowledge.
 To break this result (and create a need, either individually or in aggregate,
 for noncompete agreements), we need to make spinouts a negative-sum game.
 This can be accomplished in multiple ways.
 Workers can be made risk-averse (they compete with other spinouts, and
 cannot insure against this idiosyncratic risk); financial frictions can
 be introduced to make spinning out more costly; firms can have private
 information about the quality of knowledge the worker will learn (many
 ways to model this) â€“ adverse selection problem leads to market unraveling,
 which is the just the same thing as everyone being bound by non-competes.

In general this could require a wage of zero (e.g., unpaid internships) or
 even a negative wage (e.g., funding your own PhD).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, can this model be used to explain any macroeconomic series, such
 as the decrease in dynamism (specifically, decrease in short-term jobs)?
 Well, an increase in the use of non-competes certainly *could* in principle,
 but I don't think it's a decrease in the turnover rate of high-skill jobs
 that's really causing this shift.
 It seems like it's short-term work (potentially the rise of temp agencies
 etc.) that does this.
 Plus, I'm not really that interested in this...sure, that would make this
 a more traditional

\end_inset

 paper, but whatever...this is a legitimately interesting question, in my opinion,
 and my model is a step closer to knowing the answer than anything out there..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
My model has bite to the extent that R&D decisions are affected by the presence
 of non-competes.
 There are two types of distortions in my model, each of which affects both
 types of firms (incumbents and entrants).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Invest less in R&D because it increases the rate of increase of competition
 (idea is spilled over to more people).
 I.e.
 *the act* of investing in R&D reduces your monopoly position (in this case,
 a monopoly on R&D on this product line).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Invest less in R&D because the

\begin_layout Standard
This

does not

appear to capture standard arguments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Invest less in R&D because once you have the idea, producing with it leads
 to competition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Invest less in worker's human capital (because, once you invest in it, they
 can leave - principal agent issues with long-term wage contracts).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Worker's investment in their own human capital (similar arguments).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes the whole paper a bit unsatisfying, but remember: this is a first
 pass.
 Other versions of the model could incorporate these other factors.

\begin_layout Section
Data and Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Directly, my model generates predictions about:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w(\tilde{q},m)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The amount of innovation effort (hence R&D employment / spending) 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{I}(\tilde{q},m),z_{E}(\tilde{q},m),\tilde{z}_{E}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The growth rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, I do not have data on 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 so I cannot use these predictions to calibrate the model as they are written.
 There are two ways to proceed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Match marginal distributions such as the raw distribution of wages, innovations
 efforts, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

labels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the model that then can be used to match to the data.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
AK 2017 is an example of this.
 They construct a random process, the number of citations for a patent,
 that is a function of random processes already present in the model (and
 then doesn't feed back in), in a plausible way (larger innovations are
 more likely to be cited).
 This then generates a link between the model parameters and the citation
 distribution, which can be measured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In my case, there are a few ways to do this: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Let spinouts in the model correspond to spinouts in the data (if we can
 get this data), and let succesful entrants in the model (once knowledge
 required to participate in the product 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 race becomes publicly known) correspond to non-spinouts in the data.
 Then the fraction of new entrants that are spinouts (or, better yet, the
 distribution across businesses of their likelihood of generating spin-outs
 (but have to normalize by size)) becomes a moment that can discipline the
 model.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
However, there is a problem.
 There is much else that, in the data, generates wage dispersion.
 Thus, in order for this calibration to make sense, we really want to match
 the residual wage dispersion.

 Akcigit & Kerr 2017 (AK) assume a representative agent and push all heterogenei
ty into heterogeneity of 
\emph on
firms 
\emph default
in their economy.
 Then the representative agent simply holds a portfolio of all firms in
 the economy.
 This is not quite microfounded in the sense that the agents should then
 have an incentive to instruct all of the firms to collude with each other,
 and hence each firm wouldn't be maximizing its own 
\emph on
individual 
\emph default
profit.
 In other words, creative destruction externalities would be internalized.
 So they have simply abstracted away from firm ownership, but continue to
 assume that individual firms maximize their own profits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This trick works in AK because knowledge is embodied in the

 However, the whole point of my model is that workers have the knowledge,
 and worker flows are what is behind knowledge spillovers.
 Thus, I need to have knowledge embodied in workers.
 Each worker will have a set of intermediate goods that he is capable of

 Therefore there will be a bunch of different wages and value functions

 Alternatively, we could have assumed that

 A successful R&D project on product

 Innovation effort 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 units of R&D labor, and generates innovations at rate
\begin_inset Formula

To capture the net effect of all congestion and agglomeration externalities,
 we introduce the function

 of total innovation effort.
 In general this could have any form to reflect these externalities; here,
 to keep the model simple, we assume

 In both of these events, the value to an individual with the technology

 due to Assumption 1.
 Further, recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{m}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{j}$
\end_inset

 Therefore,

 those employed by incumbents.
 Therefore they earn the same wage

 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{t}^{F}(q,m)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\big(r+\theta+\tau_{t}(q,m)\big)W_{t}^{F}(q,m) & = & \max_{z}\Big\{ z\big[A_{t}((1+\lambda)q,0)-W_{t}^{F}(q,m)\big]-w_{t}(q,m)R_{E}(z)\Big\}\\

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{E}(q,m)$

 is the argmax.
 Note that, in contrast with the incumbent, individual spin-out does not
 take into account the effect of its level of employment on the spillovers
 of knowledge.
 This is because each individual spin-out is infinitesimal relative to the
 entire mass of spin-outs or to the mass of the incumbent.
