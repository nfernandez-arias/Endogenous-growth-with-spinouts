The PDE is 
\[
W(q,m,n)=-qW_{q}+nW_{m}+(K-n)W_{n}+\max(0,C[A-W(q,m,n)]-D)
\]

Simplified, but I don't think it affects the answer. Just removed
some multiplicative constants. Can be simplified further if it's easier
to think about, 
\[
W(q,m,n)=-qW_{q}+nW_{m}+(K-n)W_{n}+C[A-W(q,m,n)]-D
\]

I think I have the boundary conditions 

\begin{align*}
W_q(0,m,n) &= 0 \\
W_m(q,\overline{m},n) &= 0
\end{align*}

but I don't think I have an analogous one for $W_n(q,m,n^*)$.
