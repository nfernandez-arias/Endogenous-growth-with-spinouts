Incumbents can *crush* startups who try to compete with them, because first-move

 This threat to compete ensures that employees who leave to found startups

 This of course depends - if they are able to form a new technology that

Questions to answer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the contribution of spin-outs to growth? Is there too much spinning
 out? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Need a model of what the benefits of spin-outs are (how big is the quality
 improvement?) and what the costs are (inefficiencies as resources are reallocat
ed and organizational capital is redeveloped in the new firm).
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Most ambitious: quantitatively, to what extent does the combination of barriers
 to entry and creative destruction bring us close to the optimal amount
 of innovation?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In order to answer this question need a realistic model of the most important
 decisions that can be distorted by the hold-up problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Realistically, these are: (1) investments in innovation, and (2) investments
 in the worker's human capital.
 In the simplest model, we will focus on (1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Note: 
\series default
threat of entry has different effects on incumbent activity depending on
 assumptions of knowledge spillovers and so on.
 For example, can incumbents invest to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

get a lead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 against potential entrants? If knowledge spillovers are immediate (e.g.
 innovations are patented and publicized), there will be no such incentive.

may also model incumbent knowledge as partly *embodied* by the worker.
 So, worker can leave and spill over, but also *take* the knowledge with
 him.
 Makes the hold up problem worse, I guess.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Why do non-competes exist and why has their prevalence increased over time
 (check!)?.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There is evidence that workers are signing these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

by mistake.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Marx & Fleming, 2012)If so, they are not even known to be mutually beneficial
 transactions and are likely suboptimal even if we ignore the effects on
 competition and knowledge spillovers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To the extent that workers sign these contracts knowingly, they are at least
 (perceived to be) mutually beneficial agreements.
 Of course, workers could be exhibiting myopia.
 However, my conjecture is that workers are unwilling to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pay
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the price to obtain employement without a non-compete for many reasons.
 Then non-competes are mutually beneficial, but may be deleterious in general
 equilibrium due to a decrease in the vibrancy of the economy / start-up
 culture / etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The basic argument is that the firm is more risk-neutral than the worker
 with respect to startup or competition risk.
 The worker is therefore not sure whether he will 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cash out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 his knowledge.
 However, the firm hires many workers, and knows with quite some certainty
 that a certain fraction of them will (in the absence of a non-compete agreement
) defect to other employers or start their own firms and thereby compete
 with the employer.
 This argument works to the extent that the game played by the employer
 and its employees is non-positive or low sum (it is negative in the baseline
 case of a monopoly in an uninnovative industry seeking to restrict competition).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In reality there is some worker heterogeneity, and this complicates things.
 The best situation would be if workers could verifiably demonstrate their
 type to the firm.
 Then the firm could offer low buyout prices to workers who know they will
 not leave anyway (although this won't affect anything so it doesn't really
 matter).
 Another more interesting dimension of heterogeneity is that of to what
 degree the worker will compete with the firm once he leaves.
 Workers who will do positive sum projects (but which nevertheless build
 on the knowledge acquired at the firm) will be given low prices to buy
 out of their non-competes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Asymmetric information and adverse selection: 
\series default
even in the absence of risk aversion by employees, once we consider an environme
nt of asymmetric information – where employees have some knowledge of their
 own, say, ability to start a business or move to a competitor – the market
 may unravel.
 Given a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

price
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of buying out one's non-compete, only those employees of high type will
 choose to buy out.
 If the game is roughly zero-sum, the fact that these employees are willing
 to pay this price to buy out their non-compete is proof that they are not
 compensating the firm enough at this price.
 I.e.
 classic adverse selection and the market unravels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Interestingly, more asymmetric information could help ameliorate the problem.
 For example, if the employees of the highest type are that way because
 they have truly magnificent ideas that will revolutionize the economy,
 there will be a source of participants in the market whose compensation
 to the firm exceeds their cost to it from starting up / leaving the firm.
 This seems like a strange case, but it's worth considering.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Simplest version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Model based on Klette & Kortum, with endogenous knowledge spillovers through
 workers spinning out new firms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Workers employed at a firm learn how to produce products the firm makes
 at the quality the firm makes them
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These workers can then choose to compete with the existing firm:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Easier: they form the mass of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

potential entrants
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Free entry condition no longer necessarily holds and they earn rents in
 equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Harder, but more subtle: they can also simply choose to produce the *same*
 product, with the same quality.
 Not clear if this adds much and it requires changing the model much more
 so put it aside for now.
\end_layout

\end_deeper

More complicated versions

Two possibilities:
\end_layout

Model regular workers moving, source of additional discipline of the model
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Key ingredients: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Firms invest in developing knowledge that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

leaks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to employees (who can then start competing firms)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Non-trivial competition between employers (so workers can move to rival
 firms).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bargaining between workers and firms (so that non-competes can affect worker
 bargaining power, in addition to restricting growth).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This model is getting too complicated, I think.
 Need to focus on one of the stories.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection*
Data

\begin_layout Itemize
Need to follow high-skill workers from company to company and use this to
 calibrate the mechanism in the model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inspired by AK 2017: write model to be able to interpret data you wouldn't
 expect.
 He writes model relating size of innovation to the likelihood of being
 cited by future patents; then uses patent citation distribution to estimate
 the parameters governing the relative sizes of the different kinds of innovatio
ns in the economy.
 Here, the analogous thing would be to write a model relating the size of
 an innovation to the likelihood of it being spun out (e.g.
 large innovations are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stolen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by workers, small ones are sold to the incumbent) and then use the rate
 of spinouts to estimate the relative sizes of innovations.
 This honestly sounds kind of dumb but keep thinking abocut it.
