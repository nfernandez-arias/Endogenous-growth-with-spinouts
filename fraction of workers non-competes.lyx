\begin_layout Standard
Take the model I have written, but suppose instead that it's a fraction
 of people who are bound by non-competes, and it is discovered upon them
 learning the idea whether they are bound.
 If they are bound, they are bound forever.
 This reduces the problem to two state variables.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Role for non-competes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few possibilities: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Current approach: workers can open firms even when employed, so they cannot
 commit not to compete in the model by continuing to work for the incumbent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ad-hoc preclude the firm from offering a different wage to workers with
 knowledge ex-post to keep them employed and implement that way a (costly)
 non-compete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create some friction that prevents firms from doing this.
 Do we observe this behavior in the data?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allow firms to do this, but note that there is still a role for non-competes
 because this commitment is costly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Efficiency of non-competes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We establish a role for non-competes by hypothetically allowing for situations
 in which they are able to attain better allocations for the contracting
 pair than when they are not available.
 But then we have to establish the efficiency properties of non-competes
 by considering what frictions we want to study and their effects on bilateral
 efficiency (behavioral biases, no consideration, etc.) and social efficiency
 (monopoly power, financial frictions).
 Also, do we want to allow firms to commit to a buyout? If so, if this doesn't
 happen in practice, we need a friction that makes this something they choose
 not to do â€“ is writing out contracts just

costly

? Well, the model could actually tell you how costly it would have to be
 to not be worth doing, if we allow it...etc.
