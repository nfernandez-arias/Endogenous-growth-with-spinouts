\begin_layout Title
Endogenous growth model with non-competes and knowledge spillovers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Franco & Filson model is very crude, not embedded in a Klette & Kortum framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Existing work on the relative contribution of young vs.
 old (or small vs.
 large) firms to endogenous growth takes knowledge spillovers as exogenous
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Also takes barriers to entry as exogenous - no credit frictions, just an
 exogneous fixed entry cost
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Rossi-Hansberg & Chatterji 2009 - workers are the source of ideas, startups
 vs.
 existing firms.
 But no knowledge spillover - ideas simply arrive to workers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Franco & Filson 2006 - very crude (e.g.
 discrete set of levels of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know-how), and has the peculiar result that this kind of knowledge spillover
 is Pareto optimal.w
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Note on Pareto optimality: I think the result is sensitive to the assumption
 about risk neutrality.
 If workers are risk averse, they will understand that their likelihood
 of successfully spinning out with the idea depends on all other employees
 in their cohort (either because they will all race together, or because
 at the time of hiring it is not clear who will be the one to race).
 However, the firm is risk-neutral with respect to this idiosyncratic worker
 risk - whoever it is, the firm will suffer the same amount.
 The workers will not value this knowledge as much as the firm and hence
 will not fully compensate the firm with lower wages for the lost value
 from the leaking knowledge.
 The firm will internalize this and consequently reduce its investment in
 knowledge that can be appropriated by its employees (and potentially distort
 firm organization by keeping employees on a need-to-know basis for critical
 tech, reducing the ability to crowdsource ideas -is a prediction that there
 will be less innovative output per employee in large firms?)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Given this, it would be useful to extend the standard neo-Schumpeterian
 endogenous growth framework in Akcigit & Kerr 2017 or Acemoglu & Cao 2015
 to include worker flows and their role in knowledge diffusion and growth.
 And using the model to study non-competes.
 Along the way figure out if the identification in AK 2017 is really as
 bad as you think it is.
