\begin_layout Title
Motivation of Non-Competes project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Some empirical facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
California has more tech employment, more tech startups, more job mobility,
 more innovation.
 California does not enforce non-competes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Originally, tech employment / startups were concentrated in Massachusetts
 (which does enforce), but over time they moved to California (which does
 not enforce).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
More business formation in response to exogenous increases in supply of
 VC funding (Samila-Sorenson).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
California (and non-enforcing states more generally) pay the same worker-jobs
 higher NPV of wages, and a different time-profile of wages (Balasubramaniam
 et al.
 2017)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
More enforcement, but conditional on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

requiring consideration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, increases firm training of workers without reducing average wages (Starr
 2017, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Consider this: ...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Enforcement of non-competes leads to more emigration of knowledge workers
 towards non-enforcing states (Marx).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Enforcement of non-competes leads to less dynamism, etc.
 (Marx) (remember exactly what he finds).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Should we allow non-competes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do these facts imply that all states should reduce their enforcement of
 non-competes to California's level?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Two questions:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If we assume that the facts above are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

causal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense of reflecting the causal impact of non-compete enforcement,
 what do we conclude?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do we think the above mechanisms are causal?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If we think mechanisms are causal...
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(1) is close but not quite enough on its own because we don't know the welfare
 effects - e.g.
 what happens to wages (hence inequality between workers and firms), creative
 destruction, other stuff i can't think of right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(2) is a similar fact to (1): California overtook vs.
 California has more.
 So it doesn't really add much to the question of optimal policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(3) gives us another sense in which these places are more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dynamic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hence tells us something about innovation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(4) tells us something about wages hence worker welfare
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
...but really, should we think these mechanisms are causal?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
(1) on its own is not very compelling, because there could be other factors
 influencing - maybe California is more innovative because of other policies,
 institutions, demographics, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(2), being a similar fact to (1), doesn't add much, but there are arguments
 one could make.
 People have written models in which the non-enforcing state starts off
 with fewer firms and less economic activity, and later overtakes the the
 enforcing state.
 So (2) is at least plausibly causal.
 And if no other California characteristics have changed (and the weather
 certaintly didn't), then it's kind of the only candidate explanation.
 However, characteristics did change – population grew, Stanford grew, etc.
 all later than in Massachusetts – so it could just be that going on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(3) I don't doubt their identification of the sensitivity to exogenous changes
 in supply of VC funding - that is solid IV work.
 So they can identify for each state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 the sensitivity 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 to an increase in the supply of VC funding, but they cannot test whether
 the correlation of enforcement and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 is causal or spurious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(4) I may have some issues with their work - i'm skeptical that they are
 really comparing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same worker, the same job
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 across non-compete enforcement regimes.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Itemize
There are some things that can be done - for example, diff-in-diff or diff-in-di
ff-in-diff designs leave you with correlations that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

less likely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be spurious.
 More below.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Let's get into more detail.
 How do we actually convince ourselves of a causal relationship between
 non-compete enforceability and some economic outcome?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose first, to simplify, that state economies were totally isolated island
 economies.
 Then we can ignore (6).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduced form approach I: if we have a bunch of islands with varying degrees
 of enforcement, and we can observe all of the other relevant characteristics,
 then we could run a cross-sectional regression like 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{i}=\alpha+\beta\times NC_{i}+\gamma\cdot X_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 indexes the island, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the relevant outcome variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $NC_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a variable encoding the strength of non-compete enforcement, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 are island characteristics that affect the outcome, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 is an error term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
More general forms, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{i}=F(NC_{i},X_{i},\varepsilon_{i};\theta)
\]

\end_inset

 e.g.
 non parametric, can be estimated if we have enough observations (and enough
 variation across the entire range of values for each observation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The problem is: we don't have enough islands, even to do the linear regression!
 At best, we have 50 states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Further problem: we don't observe the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 So we need to use proxies.
 A model could help in constructing proxies, but hard to see how it could
 be identified.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduced form approach II: exploit natural experiments.
 We can estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in the equation, or 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{NC_{i}}$
\end_inset

 in the general formulation, without all the necessary data points if we
 suppose that we observe an exogenous change in 
\begin_inset Formula $NC_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Best example of this approach is the Marx paper on the MARA in Michigan.
 For every one of the hypotheses above, one could in principle check whether
 they hold in the time series in this experiment.
 E.g., one could check (3) 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we can add connections between islands
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We can put this into the previous framework by adding characteristics of
 other islands 
\begin_inset Formula $-i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If innovative capacity in one state affects the RHS variables of any other
 state we have an endogeneity problem, but I will ignore this for now.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
What about (1) + (2)?
