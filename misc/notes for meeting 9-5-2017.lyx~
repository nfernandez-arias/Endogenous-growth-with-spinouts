Meeting 9-5-2017

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the role of my paper? It seems too stylized to be quantitative,
 too quantitative to be conceptual...caught in the middle..and I don't see it
 as explaining secular changes in worker flows (at least, not the kind of
 thing I'm talking about - maybe the rampant use of non-competes at places
 like Jimmy John's, I don't know, but that's not really what my paper is
 about).

Effects of 
\series bold
USING non-competes
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Positive for growth: 
\series default
Firms can train workers, tell them secrets, etc.
 without worrying about immediate defection.
 Workers can commit not to tell.
 I.e.
 they get over the commitment problem, which improves welfare...
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Present whenever the argument in Franco & Filson fails - i.e.
 whenever flow benefit to workers of knowledge gained is less than flow
 loss to incumbent of reduction in monopoly position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many potential aspects of firm training that are missing here.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Positive for growth: 
\series default
Firms can develop IP in the first place, knowing that they will be able
 to train workers in using that IP to produce goods and services without
 worry of destroying their monopoly position (the reason they developed
 the IP in the first place).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Positive for growth: 
\series default
Increases the incentive for entry, since the value of having a monopoly
 position increases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Negative for growth: 
\series default
Less knowledge spillover, effectively shifting inwards the production possibilit
y frontier of the economy.
 If the model exhibits too much innovation due to business stealing externality,
 this can be good:

Harder for employees to figure out their ideal worker-employee match.

Not present in my model at all.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Negative:

workers have less incentive to invest in their own human capital (because
 their employer does not have to pay a competitive wage)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Not present in my model at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, is this a real thing? Why can't the employer just offer to pay
 the employee for developing their human capital? need to think more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

to the extent that an individual firm is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

experiment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whose quality the worker can learn, using non-competes makes reallocation
 from

\end_inset

 trials to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 trials slower.
 This is a headwind to growth.
 Related to #3, but different in that there it's the worker / firm match
 that is a trial, and here it is the firm on its own.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Not all of these forces are present in my model so it is not clear how reliable
 of an answer it will give to the question of what are the effects on growth
 / innovation / etc.
 from binding employees with non-competes vs.
 not doing so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Moreover, we aren't interested in the effect on GROWTH of USING NON-COMPETES.
 We are interested in the effect on WELFARE of ENFORCING NON-COMPETES.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So, my paper is an incomplete answer to a question which is not even really
 the question of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Would it be a more compelling contribution to isolate a specific way in
 which the option to enforce non-competes leads to agents signing a bilateral
 contract which then somehow hurts the rest of the economy? Not sure this
 would even be easier...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Other notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adverse selection in the market for knowledge - firms don't know which workers
 are the ones who will run off and steal their ideas.
 Any wage carries with it an implicit price for the knowledge that will
 be spilled over.
 If they charge a given wage, calibrated to offset the cost of future spinoffs,
 then only agents of a higher type - more likely to spin off - will take
 the job.
 This means they have to pay an even lower wage, i.e.
 charge more for the knowledge.
 And so on.
 The market for knowledge of this form collapses, and non-competes are signed.
 What happens if we don't allow non-compete agreements? Previously my rough
 intuition was that it would be a good thing, somehow reawakening this market.
 But maybe not...maybe it just kills the entire market for R&D labor.
 It's not at all obvious to me, but I don't have much intuition for this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why is my model inefficient *without* noncompetes? The benefit to a worker
 of a successful spinoff is slightly larger than the cost to the incumbent
 of being replaced, since there is a quality improvement.
 However, the net benefit to the worker of acquiring the knowledge from
 the incumbent is lower than the loss to the incumbent.
 For, roughly speaking, the loss to the incumbent is simply the previously
 cited quantity (loss in the event of a successful spinoff) multiplied by
 the probability, but the gain to the worker is this same probability multiplied
 by: slightly more than this amount (bc of quality improvement) minus the
 discounted present value of the R&D costs the worker will pay.
 Thus, the employee will not be willing to take a pay cut that compensates
 the employer for the lost knowledge, and R&D will be distorted downwards.
