Observations:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Non-competes very common among senior executives (70.2%, Garmaise 2011),
 electrical engineers (50%, Marx 2011), and 
\emph on
especially 
\emph default
common among companies receiving investments from VC firms (90%, Kaplan
 & Stroemberg 2003).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
non-competes solve a hold-up problem but also can reduce the dissemination
 of knowledge, reallocation of workers to better-matched firms, and reduce
 competition (even if there is no knowledge spillover).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
non-competes are heavily enforced in some states (e.g., MA, TX) but very weakly
 enforced in other states (e.g., CA).

Question: 
\series default
What is the effect of non-competes on growth, business / labor-market dynamism,
 and welfare? What is the optimal non-compete enforcement policy? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Growth and welfare:
\series default
 pretty clear reason why this matters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Labor market dynamism: 
\series default
Would be interesting to see what the prediction of the model is for labor-market
 dynamism and see if that helps to explain the decline documented in e.g.
 Hyattt & Spletzer IZA 2013.
 However, as they document, the decline in hires and separations has been
 driven largely by a decline in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

short-term jobs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and is largest in recessions.
 Not sure how this squares with the secular increase in the usage of non-compete
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, as pointed out in Ghosh et.
 al.
 2016, firms will enter into informal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

non-poaching
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 agreements with other firms in the absence of non-compete enforcement.
 This implies: (1) we have to be careful about how we model the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no enforcement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 regime; (2) since this practice appears to be somewhat common in Silicon

 Especially in light of Marx et.

Brain drain
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, it's plausible that enforcing non-competes in a particular region leads
 to underperformance largely due to brain drain, i.e.
 the effect of not enforcing non-competes in certain regions is to depress
 national output, but also shift it to regions where non-competes are not
 enforced.

So far modeling ONE aspect of this - people leaving to form competing startups.
 Still, works in the same direction - the more ppl you employ in R&D, the
 more competition you will have.
 This lowers the investment in R&D, because you want to prevent this spillover
 of knowledge.

: Workers routinely take actions to avoid the potential consequences of
 non-compete infringement, as was illustrated by an engineer in the internet-sea
rch industry we happened to come in contact with.
 Previously based in New York, he had worked at another internetsearch firm
 when an attractive offer arrived from a competitor with a nearby office.
 When his former employer verbally threatened him with legal action (though
 no suit was formally brought) the new employer changed his job offer from
 its New York office to its California office.
 “That non-compete,” said the engineer in a thick Brooklyn accent, “is the
 only reason I’m working in California today.”

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Focuses entirely on the effect of non-compete enforcement on entry decisions
 and considers financing constraints.
 Without financing constraints, non-compete enforcement is optimal because
 workers can simply buy out their non-competes when they have an idea that
 improves the joint surplus.
 With financing constraints, non-compete enforcement can be suboptimal because

Extremely complicated ad-hoc model that is hard to read and very partial
 equilibrium.
 Unsatisfying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example, they do not model the labor market explicitly.
 Hence, they are simply 
\emph on
shutting off 
\emph default
in an ad-hoc way the mechanism for efficiency w/o non-competes in Franco
 & Filson 2006.
 They justify this decision informally by citing one of the reasons I describe
 below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Moreover, because they do not model the labor market explicitly, they can't
 really claim to show that it is *enforcement* of non-competes that is bad,
 but rather *forcement*, if you will, of non-competes (also a shortcoming
 of my model right now, though).

Instead, it is more a story of: what is the optimal allocation of property

 the employees are the ones having the ideas in this economy, and given
 the contracting frictions, the only way to get the ideas to *happen* is

Challenges:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Solving the actual model 
\series default
is hard.
 Because workers earn human capital from working in R&D, and the value of
 this human capital depends on the quality and market structure (i.e.
 # of current competitors) of that product, their wage will be discounted
 for more profitable R&D projects.
 But this breaks the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 nature of the model, which is one of the aspects that makes these endogenous
 growth models w/ quality ladders tractable.
 So, to solve the model, I will need to explicitly represent the state,
 
\begin_inset Formula $(q,m)$
\end_inset

, both of which are unbounded, and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 takes discrete jumps...It's quite challenging, and I can't really think of
 a way around it.
 Besides brute force, my main idea is to make R&D workers not have the choice
 of which firm to work at.
 This is quite strange, I agree, but it would have the effect of making
 the wage they receive simply scale with the productivity of the economy,
 and then everything would scale with 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 if we made a suitable change to the R&D technology of incumbents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Efficiency of equilibrium: 
\series default
Equilibrium wihtout non-competes appears to be inefficient, which means
 my model can't generate a need for non-competes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
In Franco & Filson 2006, without non-competes the equilibrium is efficient.
 This is because workers compensate employers for the leaked knowledge by
 accepting lower wages in equilibrium: the classic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge spillover
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 externality in endogenous growth models disappears when these spillovers
 only take place within the context of a competitive employment arrangement.
 I believe this result holds in my model as-is, so that the equilibrium
 would be Pareto efficient (at least along this dimension - if anything
 this implies that the equilibrium will in general have 
\emph on
too much growth 
\emph default
since we are only left with the creative destruction externality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There are two fundamental reasons for this result, as I understand it:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The (subjective) joint surplus from defection is weakly larger than the
 joint surplus from cooperation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Investment (by firms and/or workers) and learning (by workers) is observable.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If either of these assumptions do not hold, the equilibrium without the
 option for non-competes is inefficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If what the employee gains from defecting is smaller than what the firm
 loses, then non-competes will be involved in the optimal contract.
 If moreover this wedge exists forever (meaning, the value to the worker
 of using the knowledge in any future period is smaller than the loss to
 the incumbent from that knowledge being used in that future period) this
 (bilaterally) optimal contract will involve a 
\emph on
permanent 
\emph default
non-compete.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is difficult to break in my model, as well, because I am only focusing
 on employees leaving to *start* firms.
 If employees were leaving to work, then, intuitively, eventually losing
 the idea wouldn't cost much to the incumbent (since profits will have been
 competed away anyway), but would be worth something to the employee who
 can use it productively (by being employed by a different employer, potentially
 in a different industry).
 So this causes non-competes to be less than infinite in practice.
 But in my model, it seems like this would not occur: if the effect of defection
 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is to reduce the joint surplus between the different *firms* with that
 knowledge, then it will always be this way in periods 
\begin_inset Formula $t'>t$
\end_inset

.
 Think about this a bit more.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 And in either case, without such a contract, there will be a socially suboptima
l level of investment by the firm (however this might be compensated by
 increased employee mobility, more on that below).
 This follows immediately by comparing the value to the employee of two
 alternative contracts offered by the firm which make the firm indifferent,
 one of which involving a non-compete.
 The worker essentially will be unwilling to fully compensate the firm,
 since he does not see all of these benefits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Franco & Filson result depends on the worker paying for the part of
 the investment that the firm undertakes that benefits him.
 This only works if this amount of investment is specified in the employment
 contract.
 If this cannot be specified legally, and if reputational concerns cannot
 allow for commitment to honor investment promises, then the optimal contract
 may make use of restrictions on employee mobility.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
I am most interested in breaking this equivalence through (1) for now.
 Variety of ways to do this:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Financial frictions (making it more costly for spinoffs to enter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adjustment costs (makes it more costly to build a business, more costly
 to liquidate, so works on both sides of the equation by making the cost
 to the incumbent greater and the benefit to the defector smaller).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Risk aversion by employees.
 Idiosyncratic risk (who will start the startup? them or their coworkers)
 not perceived by the firm generates this wedge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Private information about the quality of the knowledge that will be spilled
 over.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Application of logic in Rossi-Hansberg & Chatterjee, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Spin-offs and the market for ideas
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: hiring someone without a non-compete is analogous to selling an idea.
 With private information all ideas must sell at the same price, hence there
 is adverse selection and the market unravels unless we 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

force
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 some firms to sell their ideas.
 Interestingly, one way to accomplish this is by 
\emph on
not enforcing non-competes
\emph default
.
 This forces all ideas to be sold at the pooling price, reviving the market
 for ideas (and knowledge spill overs).
 If, at the investment stage, the quality of the discovered knowledge is
 not known, then with risk-neutrality this will not be a problem.
 However, if firms know which investments will be more productive, then
 the fact that they are forced to sell at a pooling price means that the
 most productive investments will receive too little investment.
 Essentially, we will have pushed the adverse selection problem earlier
 into the production process: instead of agents with high quality ideas
 not bringing them to market, agents with the potential to develop those
 ideas simply do not develop them in the first place.
