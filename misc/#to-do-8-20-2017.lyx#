Non-competes project

\begin_layout Itemize
Now that I have my model mostly set up, can think about how to improve it
 while trying to solve it numerically.
 To this end:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
See 
\emph on
Remark 1 
\emph default
in 
\family typewriter
draft.lyx.
 
\family default
Are firms worried about people leaving to start firms that destroy their
 monopolies? Really? And is it R&D that leads to people taking the knowledge
 (this seems more reasonable, to be honest).
 In order to model this kind of problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Similar non-compete enforcement policies - similar exceptions, e.g.
 sale of a business
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many argue broadly that non-compete enforcement is bad for innovation.
 But their preferred examples of excesses are in non-IP work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Not much evidence that non-competes are bad for growth except in the cross-secti
on.
 At worst, this is vulnerable to an endogeneity concern; at best, it is
 vulnerable to the standard critique of the Autor-Dorn-Hanson methodology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Specificaly: it could be the case that not enforcing non-competes in some
 region reduces aggregate economic activity, but reallocates economic activity
 to non-enforcing regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To investigate whether this is the case:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Ideally 
\series default
one would have a realistic model of the employment process - including all
 margins for investment that may be distorted by the presence of non-competes,
 and a realistic model (read: not perfect competition) of the labor market
 - and then allow firms and workers to endogenously allow contracts.
 Then, we can (1) compare the BGPs of an economy where CNC are enforced
 to that of an economy where they are not; and (2) construct an economy
 with an enforcing and a non-enforcing region, and analyze dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
However 
\series default
this is too difficult to do.
 An easier paper would be to remove the endogeneity of non-competes.
 This is analogous to removing the endogeneity of the amount of equity funding
 taken by entrepreneurs / banks / etc.
 in a macro-finance model.
 We are basically saying: suppose you have an industry / occupation in which
 you guess that, with non-competes allowed, they will be signed.
 What is the effect of enforcement in such an industry? Assuming we are
 able to find such an industry with high-confidence, this is fine.
 It may not be a bad assumption to assume that all R&D jobs would have non-compe
tes were they enforced.
 And, this assumption can be tested, which would add credibility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
This is too hard 
\series default
because we cannot burden firms in this model with such a complicated problem
 - we already have two state variables! This is a problem because the mechanism
 by which a non-compete reduces the worker's incentive to invest human capital
 seems to work via human capital only being rewarded in the event of a job-switc
h.
 However, in a perfect competition model of labor markets, workers are paid
 their marginal product.
 So it is not clear how to get such an effect, but it is clearly important
 (how important is it?).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
This may still is too hard 
\series default
because there are too many margins of investment to make the model tractable.
 One way to make this easier is to simply have two levels of worker human
 capital.
 Then we simply double the number of points (still this is near-doubling
 the complexity of the problem!!!).

\begin_layout Itemize
LOOK at what data is available - specifically Census Bureau, and read about
 data sources for worker flows.
 E.g.
 Linkedin data (for knowledge of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

skills
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Patent data (can infer skills based on being associated w/ a patent? idno).
 Need to look at this stuff to get a sense of what is out there, what is
 possible.
