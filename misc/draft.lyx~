There is a large literature considering the optimal enforcement of non-competes
 (for an excellent survey, see Marx & Fleming 2012).
 The tentative consensus that has emerged is that enforcement of non-competes
 is bad for workers and bad for growth.
 In fact, starting with Gilson 1999, many authors have ascribed Sililcon
 Valley's displacement of former high-tech hub Route 128 to California's
 blanket refusal to enforce such contracts.

 This story receives support from a variety of empirical papers, exploiting
 both time-series and cross-sectional variation (across US states) in the
 enforcement of non-competes.

One may be tempted to conclude from this body of work that non-compete agreement
s deter growth (I certainly am).
 Yet the evidence does not yet fully support this view.
 Especially in light of evidence from Marx et.
 al.
 2015 that there is brain drain from enforcing states to nonenforcing states,
 the overperformance of non-enforcing jurisdictions could simply be redistributi
on of economic activity rather than aggregate economic growth.

 More broadly, to date there has not been an aggregate welfare analysis
 using a workhorse general equilibrium macroeconomic model of long-run industry
 evolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three main questions that can in principle be answered with a
 general equilibrium model and not with the kinds of studies that have so
 far been conducted.
 First, welfare in an economy where all workers are bound by non-competes
 can be compared to welfare in an economy where non-competes are not enforced.
 Next, can we write a general equilibrium model with enforcing and non-enforcing
 regions which can reproduce the existing empirical evidence (i.e.
 brain drain causing differential performance).
 Finally, in reality, workers and jobs are heterogeneous, so that in certain
 cases non-competes have relatively more pros than cons.
 In this vein, one can ask the question: to what extent does the market
 endogenously assign / enforce non-competes to workers whose consequent
 lack of mobilty is on balance relatively less harmful to the aggregate
 economy?

The contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for
 conducting an analysis of the first question above.
 I develop a model based on Klette & Kortum 2004 (itself a modification
 of Hopenhayn 1992), endogenizing knowledge spillovers by way of worker
 flows.
 To perform this analysis the model must be rich enough to include the various
 decisions by employers and employees that can be distorted by the presence
 of non-competes.
 These include firm investments in R&D, firm investments in the worker's
 human capital, and employee's investments in their own human capital.
 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model, by necessity, must have many parameters or assumptions (about
 relationships between the fewer assumed parameters).
 There is no way around this.
 I will offer some guidance as to how to obtain empirical discpiline on
 these parameters.
 My hope is that the policy prescriptions to emerge from my analysis will
 depend in a clear way on certain key elasticities, which will suggest a
 future path for research to uncover these for different industries.

\begin_layout Standard
In a standard quality ladder model (i.e.
 Aghion & Howitt, Grossman & Helpman), agents invest in knowledge capital
 because it allows them to earn, for a time, monopoly profits.
 When entering, entrants 
\emph on
creatively destroy 
\emph default
incumbents' monopoloy positions, leading their pivate payoff from innovation
 to be higher than the social payoff; simultaneously, incumbents (and entrants)
 do not enjoy all the social benefits of their investments (since there
 will be spillovers), hence they underinvest in knowledge relative to the
 social optimum.
 Depending on parameters, one force is stronger than the other and the decentral
ized equilibrium exhibits too much or too little innovation relative to
 the first-best.
 My model builds on these models by endogenizing the mechansim by which
 knowledge diffuses through the economy.
 In particular, 
\emph on
using 
\emph default
knowledge requires employing workers, and this inevitably 
\emph on
diffuses 
\emph default
that knowledge, harming one's monopoly poisition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Franco & Filson 2006 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "franco_filson2006"

\end_inset

) study a model of knowledge creation, diffusion and spinoffs in which the
 competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal.
 In their model, however, there is no creative destruction: if someone imitates
 my knowledge, the profits I earn from my knowledge do not decrease.
 The only externality is that of knowledge spillover, and this externality
 is internalized in equilibrium by high-knowledge firms paying lower wages.
 The outcome is hence Pareto optimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My model differs due to the creative destruction.
 In the absence of some contract that prevents this spillover, the private
 value of knowledge in the economy decreases.
 It is not enough for employees to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compensate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the creator of knowledge by paying them the social value of the knowledge,
 because in equilibrium, the inability to sustain monopoly power leads knowledge
 to be worth less.
 To see the intuition most clearly, consider a case that does not appear
 in the model but illustrates the concept most clearly: an auction.
 Suppose that I can put in effort to uncover the true value of the item
 being auctioned, but that I can only do so by hiring at least one other
 person.
 Suppose that I also cannot prevent this person from using the knowledge,
 but that there is a competitive fringe of such agents that I may choose
 to hire.
 In equilibrium, they will compete against each other and hence will compensate
 me for the knowledge they will extract from the match.
 However, they also internalize the fact that they will have to compete
 with me in the auction, and hence neither of us will have a surplus.
 The knowledge is worth nothing in equilibrum, and I will not invest to
 obtain it.

DEPRECATED: 
\series default
The logic is essentially that spinning out is a weakly positive sum game;
 as a result, employees will be willing to take lower wages that exactly
 compensate (or even more than fully compensate) the incumbents for the
 leaking knowledge.
 To break this result (and create a need, either individually or in aggregate,
 for noncompete agreements), we need to make spinouts a negative-sum game.
 This can be accomplished in multiple ways.
 Workers can be made risk-averse (they compete with other spinouts, and
 cannot insure against this idiosyncratic risk); financial frictions can
 be introduced to make spinning out more costly; firms can have private
 information about the quality of knowledge the worker will learn (many
 ways to model this) – adverse selection problem leads to market unraveling,
 which is the just the same thing as everyone being bound by non-competes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, can this model be used to explain any macroeconomic series, such
 as the decrease in dynamism (specifically, decrease in short-term jobs)?
 Well, an increase in the use of non-competes certainly *could* in principle,
 but I don't think it's a decrease in the turnover rate of high-skill jobs
 that's really causing this shift.
 It seems like it's short-term work (potentially the rise of temp agencies
 etc.) that does this.
 Plus, I'm not really that interested in this...sure, that would make this
 a more traditional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

macro-labor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 paper, but whatever...this is a legitimately interesting question, in my opinion,
 and my model is a step closer to knowing the answer than anything out there..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
My model has bite to the extent that R&D decisions are affected by the presence
 of non-competes.
 There are two types of distortions in my model, each of which affects both
 types of firms (incumbents and entrants).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Invest less in R&D because it increases the rate of increase of competition
 (idea is spilled over to more people).
 I.e.
 *the act* of investing in R&D reduces your monopoly position (in this case,
 a monopoly on R&D on this product line).

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
does not

appear to capture standard arguments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes the whole paper a bit unsatisfying, but remember: this is a first
 pass.
 Other versions of the model could incorporate these other factors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
There is an issue in my model that stems from the interaction of the 2-d
 continum across goods and across entrants within a good, and the fact that
 any individual entrant's arrival destroys every other entrant's intellectual
 property.
 In AK 2017, the authors write the following HJB for a potential entrant
 (simplifying some stuff for exposition): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
rV_{0}=\max_{x_{e}}x_{e}\Big[V(q_{j}+\overline{q})-V_{0}\Big]-x_{e}\overline{q}\nu
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
However, this is actually a simplification of the real HJB.
 The authors omit the dependence of entrant value 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 on the aggregate state 
\begin_inset Formula $q(\cdot)$
\end_inset

, as well as the term in the HJB corresponding to the arrival of a successful
 innovation of a different entrant, which changes this aggregate state 
\begin_inset Formula $q(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 by increasing the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q(j)$
\end_inset

.
 The true HJB is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
rV_{0}(q(\cdot)) & = & \max_{x_{e}}x_{e}\Big[V(q_{j}+\lambda\overline{q})-V_{0}(q(\cdot))\Big]-c(x_{e},q(\cdot))\\
 &  & +\tau_{j}(q(\cdot))\Big[V_{0}(\tilde{q}(\cdot))-V_{0}(q(\cdot))\Big]
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{j}(q(\cdot))$
\end_inset

 is aggregate innovation arrival rate on line 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 from a different entrant) given the aggregate state 
\begin_inset Formula $q(\cdot)$
\end_inset

, and where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}(\cdot)=q(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 except at 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}(j)=q(j)+\lambda\overline{q}$
\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}$
\end_inset

 differs from 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 only on a set of measure 0, it seems reasonable to conclude that (show
 more rigorously)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{0}(\tilde{q}(\cdot))=V_{0}(q(\cdot))
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
and therefore this term drops out in their case.
 However, in my case, the analogous term is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau(q,m,n)\phi(\tau(q,m,n))\Big[0-W^{F}(q,m,n)\Big]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
because when a different entrant successfully enters, a potential entrant
 in my model loses a positive value of intellectual capital (rather than
 simply continuing to be an entrant with the same value as in AK 2017).
 Therefore, I need to take seriously the question of how the intensities
 of own innovation and others' innovation compare to each other.
 On the one hand, it seems that .

 What are some forces that could be in my model leading to non-competes

 socially inefficient, leading to a potential to want to regulate non-competes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark

\series bold
The takeaway:
\series default
 allowing non-competes will only be constrained inefficient if they lead
 to the employer-employee pair solidifying their joint monopoly position
 in some capacity.
 However, 
\emph on
even then, 
\emph default
it may not be constrained inefficient: both because 
\series bold
monopoly power can have some surprising static constrained efficiency properties
\series default
 (for example, in R&D, less congestion); and
\series bold
 dynamic constrained efficiency properties
\series default
 because 
\series bold
static monopoly power
\series default
 increases appropriation of the rents from innovation, aligning more the
 incentive of innovators with the incentive of society
\series bold
 (they may increase inequality though)
\series default
.
 Of course, 
\series bold
monopoly power can also exhibit some dynamic inefficiency when it comes
 to R&D: 
\series default
to the extent that increasing quality leads firms to work their way down
 a demand curve, monopolistic firms will spend too little on R&D.
 Not sure how to think about whether / how these forces net out.
 I guess there is a chance that these offset each other and there is no
 way to reconcile them: if you give me monopoly power on both the idea and
 the research on the idea, then doing any might lower the price of the technolog
y sufficiently that none will happen anymore.
 The problem is that because the new idea displaces the old one, it is difficult
 to give a static monopoly without giving a dynamic monopoly.
 This adds to the tradeoff between increasing appropriability and static
 distortion.
 
\series bold
At the end of the day, non-competes, by creating a commitment device for
 the employee, 
\emph on
tend to increase bilateral value – 
\emph default
a good in and of itsel –
\emph on
 
\emph default
and tend to 
\emph on
increase the static and/or dynamic monopoly power
\emph default
 of the employer-employee pair, potentially bringing us closer or farther
 from this optimum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark

\series bold
My paper: 
\series default
what is this additional monopoly power used for in my model? Since there
 is only one incumbent producing and his production decision is static,
\emph on
 
\series bold
\emph default
static monopoly power is unaffected.

\series default
 However, 
\series bold
dynamic monopoly power is affected: 
\series default
this power is used to avoid congestion in the R&D race (good for society).
 Not sure if the dynamic inefficiency int he previous paragraph is there.
 
\series bold
To make non-competes potentially socially inefficient, could work in monopsony
 power
\series default
: entrants not taking into account their effect on R&D wages, but for that
 need to have elastic supply of R&D labor.
 Not clear if there is a social inefficiency in my model.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Optimal contract can no longer simply extract worker rent by paying lower
 wages, because the workers face idiosyncratic uncertainty: will they be
 the ones to get the idea? The firm does not perceive this uncertainty since
 it averages out for the firm.
 If workers are risk-averse enough, the knowledge will not be worth much
 to them initially, and it will cost too much to backload their wages by
 just giving them the promise of a potentially profitable spinout.
 Hence the optimal contract will involve the firm perfectly insuring the
 employee against such risk by taking all of the rent conditional on the
 worker spinning out, and paying the worker a higher wage today instead
 - i.e.
 a non-compete with a very large buyout.
 However, this would not be inefficient on its own: all spinouts are still
 forming, as is efficient.

At the time of spinning out:

if the employee, at the time of spinning out, has private information about
 the quality (but spinning out is always beneficial to joint value), then
 the firm will simply allow them to spin out and extract surplus through
 paying a lower wage.
 This is efficient.
 If spinning out is sometimes bad for joint value but good for employee
 value, then the firm may charge a buyout price that will screen these cases.
 Unfortunately, since there is not a perfect correlation between employee
 value and firm value, this will necessarily imply some loss.
 But it will be a loss to mutual value coming from the asymmetric information
 friction and moral hazard.
 As long as joint value is the same as social value (which we have assumed
 because we're not talking about case (1) here), this will still be constrained
 efficient from a social planner's perspective.

 But then only a few workers - who were basically worth hiring at

 If the conditions are right, the firm may optimally keep lowering the wage
 to the point that it employs no one.
 Enter non-competes.
 Now, the firm can simply require the workers to sign a non-compete and
 commit to extract the full rent in the event of a spinout (assuming all
 spinouts are bilaterally optimal).
 The firm is then free to hire the workers at the same wage.
 This feels like it would be socially optimal.

 so I cannot use these predictions to calibrate the model as they are written.
 There are two ways to proceed:

 efforts, etc.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
AK 2017 is an example of this.
 They construct a random process, the number of citations for a patent,
 that is a function of random processes already present in the model (and
 then doesn't feed back in), in a plausible way (larger innovations are
 more likely to be cited).
 This then generates a link between the model parameters and the citation
 distribution, which can be measured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In my case, there are a few ways to do this: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Let spinouts in the model correspond to spinouts in the data (if we can
 get this data), and let succesful entrants in the model (once knowledge
 required to participate in the product 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 race becomes publicly known) correspond to non-spinouts in the data.
 Then the fraction of new entrants that are spinouts (or, better yet, the
 distribution across businesses of their likelihood of generating spin-outs
 (but have to normalize by size)) becomes a moment that can discipline the
 model.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
However, there is a problem.
 There is much else that, in the data, generates wage dispersion.
 Thus, in order for this calibration to make sense, we really want to match
 the residual wage dispersion.

 Akcigit & Kerr 2017 (AK) assume a representative agent and push all heterogenei
ty into heterogeneity of 
\emph on
firms 
\emph default
in their economy.
 Then the representative agent simply holds a portfolio of all firms in
 the economy.
 This is not quite microfounded in the sense that the agents should then
 have an incentive to instruct all of the firms to collude with each other,
 and hence each firm wouldn't be maximizing its own 
\emph on
individual 
\emph default
profit.
 In other words, creative destruction externalities would be internalized.
 So they have simply abstracted away from firm ownership, but continue to
 assume that individual firms maximize their own profits.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This trick works in AK because knowledge is embodied in the

 However, the whole point of my model is that workers have the knowledge,
 and worker flows are what is behind knowledge spillovers.
 Thus, I need to have knowledge embodied in workers.
 Each worker will have a set of intermediate goods that he is capable of

Incumbent firms undertake R&D to improve the quality of the product they

 A successful R&D project on product 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

 of quality 
\begin_inset Formula $q$

.
 Innovation effort 
\begin_inset Formula $z$

 requires

 units of R&D labor, and generates innovations at rate
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{I}(z;\overline{z})=\chi_{I}z\phi(\overline{z})

To capture the net effect of all congestion and agglomeration externalities,
 we introduce the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 of total innovation effort.
 In general this could have any form to reflect these externalities; here,
 to keep the model simple, we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 is decreasing, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{z\to0}\phi(z)=+\infty$

 formed.

Why perform R&D instead of simply forming a competitor of the incumbent

 If any spin-out has to pay a small cost to play, and we assume that competition

 Note that, in contrast with the incumbent, individual spin-out does not

 This is because each individual spin-out is infinitesimal relative to the

Key tradeoff in my model: when someone obtains a monopoly, they may not
 innovate on their technology at the socially optimal rate because they
 do not internalize the fact that one day someone else may use this knowledge
 without their explicit consent (hence no bargaining, hence pareto suboptimal).
 To the extent that this is the case, it is a Pareto improvement to increase
 the amount of R&D.
 One way to accomplish this is through increasing the rate of knowledge
 spillovers, which leads to R&D by new entrants.
 While these entrants also do not take into account their effect on future
 users of the knowledge they are creating, they have another offsetting
 bias towards too much innovation stemming from the business-stealing effect
 of their innovation.
 Hence, more entry can lead to a Pareto improvement.

Without patents, the inventor cannot use the market mechanism to sell the
 knowledge to the appropriate person, for two reasons: (1) he has no mechanism
 for credibly communicating to the other agents the nature of the knowledge

 they see it; and (2) even if somehow someone knew the value of the knowledge,
 the inventor cannot commit to not using the knowledge once it is

Most non-enforcing states, including California, allow VC firms to require
 employees at the firsm they fund to sign non-competes as a condition of
 their investment.
 This suggests an alternative path for an inventor in a non-enforcing region
 who has some IP he does not want to patent for whatever reason: form a
 firm with the knowledge embodied in the firm, sell it to a VC or other
 investor, and sign a non-compete.
 If anything, this is good for my paper, because it suggests that

knowledge finding the right people

 A caveat: many would say that VC firms are not the people who we are trying
 to match with knowledge.
 What we really want is smart people in their basements who have some kind
 of brilliant way of thinking, but don't have access to this seed of knowledge
 currently possessed by the inventor.
