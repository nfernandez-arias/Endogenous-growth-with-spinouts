function out = aggregation(pa,pm,ig,V_out,W_out)

	% Here, implement the solution to the system of equations

	% To do this, first implement change of variables. This consists of defining a new grid in m'-space, and a new function tau1(m') = tau(m(m')).
	
	
	
	
	
	% This will return objects mu, gamma defined in m'-space. Since mu is a density, defining it in m-space will require a change of variables term, dm/dm' or something. come to that later.
