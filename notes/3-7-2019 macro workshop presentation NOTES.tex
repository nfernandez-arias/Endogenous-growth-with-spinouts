\title{Notes from presentation}
\author{Nicolas Fernandez-Arias}
\maketitle

\begin{itemize}
	\item Gianluca: NOTATION IS CONFUSING AND HARD TO FOLLOW; start with simple toy model to explain the economics
	\item Oleg: Is the gradual hazard rate actually important in the data? Otherwise, why not just have spinouts form randomly at some rate, without having them form this mass of spinouts? Good point...
	\item Oleg: Why not focus on employees moving to other firms? Seems like it could be more important
	\item Rogerson: Bring back slide on example to think about e.g. Fairchildren / Intel / AMD, and /or ideally a different modern example
	\item Tonetti: Hopenhayn - duplicative research - missing market
	\item Aguiar: Zoom in on R\&D wage thing - this is the key mechanism, so it should be front and center in my description of the model
\end{itemize}
