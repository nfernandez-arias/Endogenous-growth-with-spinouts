	abstract = {We build a tractable growth model in which multiproduct incumbents invest in internal innovations to improve their existing products, while new entrants and incumbents invest in external innovations to acquire new product lines. External and internal innovations generate heterogeneous innovation qualities, and firm size affects innovation incentives. We analyze how different types of innovation contribute to economic growth and the role of the firm size distribution. Our model aligns with many observed empirical regularities, and we quantify our framework with Census Bureau and patent data for US firms. Internal innovation scales moderately faster with firm size than external innovation.},

	abstract = {We extend the basic Schumpeterian endogenous growth model by allowing incumbents to undertake innovations to improve their products, while entrants engage in more “radical” innovations to replace incumbents. Our model provides a tractable framework for the analysis of growth driven by both entry of new firms and productivity improvements by continuing firms. The model generates a non-degenerate equilibrium firm size distribution driven by entry of new firms and expansion exit of existing firms. When there is also costly imitation preventing any sector from falling too far below the average, the stationary firm size distribution is Pareto with an exponent approximately equal to one (the so-called “Zipf distribution”).},

	abstract = {We build a model of firm-level innovation, productivity growth and reallocation featuring endogenous entry and exit. A key feature is the selection between high- and low-type firms, which differ in terms of their innovative capacity. We estimate the parameters of the model using detailed US Census micro data on firm-level output, R\&D and patenting. The model provides a good fit to the dynamics of firm entry and exit, output and R\&D, and its implied elasticities are in the ballpark of a range of micro estimates. We find industrial policy subsidizing either the R\&D or the continued operation of incumbents reduces growth and welfare. For example, a subsidy to incumbent R\&D equivalent to 5\% of GDP reduces welfare by about 1.5\% because it deters entry of new high-type firms. 0n the contrary, substantial improvements (of the order of 5\% improvement in welfare) are possible if the continued operation of incumbents is taxed while at the same time R\&D by incumbents and new entrants is subsidized. This is because of a strong selection effect: R\&D resources (skilled labor) are inefficiently used by low-type incumbent firms. Subsidies to incumbents encourage the survival and expansion of these firms at the expense of potential high-type entrants. We show that optimal policy encourages the exit of low-type firms and supports R\&D by high-type incumbents and entry.},

	abstract = {[The effect of firm size on the allocation of R\&D effort between process and product innovation is examined. It is hypothesized that relative to product innovations, process innovations are less saleable in disembodied form and spawn less growth. This implies that the returns to process R\&D will depend more on the firm's output at the time it conducts its R\&D than the returns to product R\&D. Incorporating this distinction in a simple model, we derive and test predictions about how the fraction of R\&D devoted to process innovation varies with firm size within industries.]},
