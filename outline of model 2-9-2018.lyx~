\begin_layout Subsection*
Why are non-competes used
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Preliminaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If ex-post it is always bilaterally optimal for the worker not to compete
 with the incumbent, non-competes will always be used and never bought out.
 The worker will be compensated ex-ante, receiving utility equal to his
 reservation wage plus his share of net surplus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the worker competing is always ex-post bilaterally optimal, non-competes
 can still be ex-ante optimal:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If value of knowledge is too high, making initial worker wages without non-compe
tes low / negative, financial frictions can get in the way, making this
 infeasible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Worker risk aversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Worker impatience relative to firm (perhaps due to liquidity concerns from
 financial frictions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Asymmetric information on the part of the worker about his ability to learn
 the knowledge / use it to harm the incumbent
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
However, given the assumption that competing is always ex-post bilaterally
 optimal, the ex-ante bilateral value of non-competes depends crucially
 on the ability of the worker to buy out the non-compete.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Financial frictions can make ex-post buyouts unaffordable, which by assumption
 reduces 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Commitment could aid this...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...but the same asymmetric information problems from above could harm that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In these cases, non-competes are bilaterally suboptimal.
\end_layout

\end_deeper

Caveat: 
\series default
If the worker is made to sign a non-compete after accepting the job offer
 and turning down other offers (as in non-consideration states), the firm
 will seek to maximize its own utility given the means at its disposal.
 Given that the firm cannot simply lower the wage paid, the firm may seek
 to increase its utility by imposing a non-compete on the worker, 
\emph on
even if 
\emph default
this reduces the bilateral value.
 This is an important point: the intuition that contracting maximizes bilateral
 value actually needs to be refined: it maximizes bilateral value 
\emph on
among the contracts that give the worker the utility he gets at the optimum.

\emph default
 This maximizes bilateral value if transfers are possible, because then
 all feasible bilateral utility values result from contracts that can be
 modified to contracts where the worker receives his reservation utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
A more realistic setting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If in some states it is optimal, and in some states suboptimal, for the
 worker to compete with the incumbent, then non-competes will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
My model is basically: unmodeled contracting, financial and information
 frictions prevent ex-post renegotiation, firms face the choice between
 non-competes or not, they choose non-competes.
 Depending on the model structure they will either be long or short.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Stylized facts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Non-enforcing regions exhibit a larger response of entrepreneurship, patenting,
 employment, and income to exogenous increases in the supply of VC funding
 (Samila-Sorenson 2011).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
NB: I am skeptical of this, since they do not allow for population, or compositi
on of population, to mediate the effect of VC funding increases.
 Since higher-impact, more collaborative entrepreneurs tend to relocate
 to non-enforcing regions (Marx 2015), local population of potential innovators
 / entrepreneurs etc.
 would be negatively correlated with non-compete enforcement, biasing the
 results in the direction of their conclusion.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Exogenous increase in enforcement leads to less frequent job switching;
 the effect is stronger for workers with firm-specific skills or who specialize
 in narrow technical occupation (Marx 2009).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Exogenous increase in enforcement leads to brain drain of inventors / knowledge
 workers towards non-enforcing regions; the effect is stronger for higher-impact
, more collaborative workers (Marx 2015).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Non-enforcing states have higher mobility, higher wages and higher wage
 growth (Balasubramaniam 2017).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
NB: I am a bit skeptical of this result because are we really comparing
 the same worker, same firm? They take steps to justify this.
 Whatever.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Wages only don't get a boost in non-Consideration enforcing states; wages
 and training higher in (consideration) enforcing states (Starr 2015

Consider this...

\begin_layout Subsection*
Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We want the model to capture the above stylized facts, which will qualify
 it as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reasonable model.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This will certainly not allow us to calibrate all parameters.
 For example, where will we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, which parametrizes markups? Below, I will sketch out a model which captures
 the above stylized facts, and discuss how the parameters will be estimated
 (i.e.
 which moments are really 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doing the work
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even if it's not analytically clean) or calibrated (if taken simply from
 the data).
\end_layout

\series default
it's a very similar paper and it has an extensive description of how it's
 calibrated and uses a bunch of data you can use.
 Cmon, you got this! Tomorrow you will CRUSH this shit.
