\section{Innovation rates}

In my model, in a small unit of time $\Delta_t$, a fraction $\bar{\tau}_{SE} \Delta_t$ of products are innovated upon by entrants or spinouts, leading to creative destruction, where 
\begin{align*}
	\bar{\tau}_{SE} &= \int_0^{\infty} \big (\tau_S(m) + \tau_E(m) \big) \mu(m) dm
\end{align*}

\section{Entry rates}

In my model, any innovation that isn't by an incumbent on their own product line or by a competing spinout is performed by a new entrant. Hence, the ``entry rate'' is misleading, as in reality this picks up external innovation by incumbent firms (just, not spinouts). One way to reconcile this in a quick and dirty way is to simply assume that only entry by spinouts is entry, and that entry by non-spinout entrants is simply entry by other incumbent firms. Hence, the 5\% entry rate in the data of AK 2017 should be compared to the entry rate by spinouts in my model. 

\section{R\&D intensity}

By ``R\&D Intensity'' I refer to Total R\&D spending by intermediate goods firms (including spinouts and entrants) divided by Total sales by intermediate goods firms. 

For a product line in state $m$ and with quality $q$, flow sales revenue is 
\begin{align*}
	s(q,m) = L_F q_j 
\end{align*}

Aggregate sales revenue is therefore simply $Q L_F$. 

For the same product, effective labor allocated to R\&D is
\begin{align*}
	z(q,m) &= z_I(q,m) + z_E(q,m) + z_S(q,m)
\end{align*}

By assumption (recall the scaling assumptions required to get a BGP), $z(q,m)$ effective units of R\&D labor requires spending $q w(m)$ on R\&D labor and in equilibrium $z(q,m) \equiv z(m)$. Hence, aggregate R\&D spending is given by 
\begin{align*}
	RD_{\textrm{agg}} &= Q \int_0^{\infty} w(m) \gamma(m) z(m) \mu(m) dm
\end{align*} 

So the economy-wide R\&D / Sales ratio is given by 
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\textrm{R\&D}}{\textrm{Sales}} &= \frac{\int_0^{\infty} w(m) \gamma(m) z(m) \mu(m) dm}{L_F}
\end{align*}
